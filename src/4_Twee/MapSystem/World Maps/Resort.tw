<p><<f y>>ou're inside the Motorboating boating store. The store seems to stock a little bit of everything, from equipment and supplies to care for your boat, to recreational items for having fun on the lake. There's also a section dedicated to fishing poles, gear, and bait, though judging by its size it doesn't seem like fishing is a very popular activity on the lake.</p>

Shocked you cant but stare on this abomination. Gigerian invertebrate reaches for your body with more and more long muscular tentacles pulling you clother and closer to the opening mouth-like inner part. The view on a pulsing insides of a creatures clicks something deep and ancient in your brain and you start struggling beyond hope trying to avoid the contact with the giant disgusting mouth of a creature at all costs. Twitching hopeleslly you lost last bubbles of air you still had in your lungs. @@.mono;NOOOOOOO! FUCK!! GET AWAYFROMME!!!@@ With a mouth open wide you scream silently as creature engulfs your torso and head with it's soft flesh.

In the darkness you inhale hoping to just lose your conciousness by drowning but you your surprise you are still awake. Water coming to your lungs feels... breathable? Your body struggles to accept it as a new source of the oxygen and it is hard to breath thick liquid but after a dosen of breathes you feel that creature's inner volume can sustain your life.</p>
<p>The most part of your body is in the soft cold pulsing womb with only your arms and legs poking outside and held by muscular tentacles. You can feel colder outer water on your back but no amount of resistance allows you to release yourself. Motionlessly, you allow the creature to do what it want asking millions of questions you have no answers to.</p>
<p>Soft touches on your stomach and face make you stiffen yourself again. You don't know what will come next and have absolutely no way to fight the abomination so you passively accept its actions just shivering with horror as little appendages touches your torso as like searching for something.

<p>Pushing to your uterus tentacle cock start pusling more and you feel it getting thicker and thicker. You can't but push yourself on this member. Bending and silently moaning you breath hard trying to get enough air from the liquid surrounding you while creature fucks you with growing fierce and amplitude. Stiff and thick tentacle waves inside your stretched pussy pushing you clother and closer to the weirdest orgasm in your life. Your hands outside of the monster mindlessly opens and close grabing nothing but a water of the lake as waves of orgasm overwhemls you one after another.

After the turn you see a light on the end of the tube which grows larger and larger until you slide out like a bullet to the pool. With a splash you submerge under the water for a moment and get your nose full of water. Getting to the surface you blow the water out and blink a couple of times. @@.mono;Phew!

<p><<f y>>ou're standing on the floating dock platform that extends out into Lake Clitea from near the resort. There's a whole variety of boats moored here, from pontoon party barges to small one-man sailboats. There's also a smaller slip off to the side with several jet skis tied there, from the look of things they're rentals.</p>
