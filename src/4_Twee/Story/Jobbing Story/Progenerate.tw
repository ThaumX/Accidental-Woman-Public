:: FecundateOrientation [nobr]

<p>
<<f i>>t's your first day at Progenerate Technologies, and everything thus far has been speeding by in a blur. Meeting your boss Sara Broodmare, being shown to your desk, meeting so many coworkers, having an access ID made, and filling out a lot of various forms that make your employment here official. The rush of activity hides the initial disconcerting feeling you felt when you realized that everyone in the Fecundate Division is female, and most of them seem to be pregnant. It's the early afternoon when Sara tells you to report to a room on the other side of the building.
</p>
<p>
You make your way there, thankfully you only have to follow the main hallway. A set of double doors are propped open, and you step into what appears to be the comfortable waiting room of a high-end clinic. Above the wide receptionist's window you see a sign stating "Welcome to the Progenerate Technologies Clinical Division". The transition from typical office atmosphere to medical clinic is a little jarring, but you notice one of your coworkers happily looking at her phone while sitting in a plush chair.
</p>
<p>
You walk up to the window, and one of the girls on the other side looks up at you with a smile. @@.npc;Hello! Can I see your ID please?@@
</p>
<p>
You open your purse and start to pull out your driver's license, when you realize she must mean your new Progenerate ID. You retrieve it and hand it to her. @@.pc;Hi, I'm new. I was told that I have an appointment here?@@
</p>
<p>
The receptionist slots your ID into a reader with a well-practice motion. @@.npc;Well then, welcome to the Progenerate family! This is the clinical division where you'll be getting your checkups and treatments. Since this is your first visit, you'll just be going over some of your basic medical information with a nurse to get your record started. Then she'll have a simple briefing for you.@@
</p>
<p>
You're a little confused by the "checkups and treatments" part. @@.pc;Umm, sorry, but what do you mean by checkups and treatments?@@
</p>
<p>
She cocks her head to the side, confused herself. @@.npc;Huh? It should be obvious, right? Anyway, you can ask the nurse during your appointment. You're all set, by the way. Please have a seat and you'll be called back momentarily.@@ She hands you back your Progenerate ID.
</p>
<p>
You shrug and head over to one of the comfy-looking chairs. It isn't long before a petite nurse opens the door and calls for you.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Miss <<surname>>?@@
</p>
<p>
You stand up and start walking to the door. She gives you a smile and holds it open for you. @@.npc;Right this way please.@@ You walk down a hallway, several of the doors are open revealing gynecological exam rooms, complete with stirrups. You reach an intersection in the hallway and take a left. It isn't long before you reach a small room. There's some equipment for measuring vitals, a standard exam table, and a desk with two chairs.
</p>
<p>
The nurse gestures at one of the chairs as she starts to sit behind the desk. @@.npc;Go ahead and have a seat miss <<surname>>.@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG_FecundateBriefing]]</center>
<p>
You sit down, and the nurse immediately launches into a series of medical questions. The questions seem to focus primarily on your medical history, specifically a lot about your immediate family and ancestors. The process takes a good deal of time, so you're relieved when the question portion draws to a close.
</p>
<p>
The nurse stands up in a businesslike manner. @@.npc;Okay miss <<surname>>, if you could just get undressed there's a quick exam to take care of.@@
</p>
<p>
You stand, but before removing any clothes you have a question or two. @@.pc;Exam? What's the exam for? And for that matter, why does Progenerate care so much about my health?@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse gives you a friendly smile. @@.npc;The exam is nothing to worry about, it's just setting a baseline. Height, weight, breast exam, and a basic visual inspection.@@ She pauses for a moment, as if considering the best way to answer. @@.npc;Well, since you'll be acting as a surrogate for Progenerate, they want to make sure that you and the babies you gestate will be healthy. From a practical standpoint, it makes much more sense to take good care of the girls in the Fecundate Division, you know?@@
</p>
<p>
You're a little shocked. @@.pc;Surrogate? Gestate? I'm not sure what's going on here...@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse takes a good look at you, and you can see a mixture of confusion and disbelief in her eyes. @@.npc;Surely you realized? It's right there in the name: "Fecundate". Even if you don't know that the definition of fecundate is to make fruitful or fertilize, you could surely guess from the root "fecund"... Fecund as in fertile, fruitful, productive, high-yielding, and prolific in terms of pregnancy.@@ She takes a breath and sighs. @@.npc;You signed and approved all the surrogate mother paperwork, and I'm pretty sure fertility is listed as a job requirement. I mean, the pay and benefits being so good for office work should be a pretty obvious clue, that there's some 'extra' work, right?@@
</p>
<p>
You stop and think about it for a bit, before answering slowly. @@.pc;Yeah, you're right... I should have realized...@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse does her best at an encouraging smile. @@.npc;Hey, look. Working in the Fecundate division is not that bad at all, okay? You get great pay, time off, and access to world-class healthcare, and even some optional fertility and body enhancement treatments if you want them.@@ She gestures to the room around you. @@.npc;I've been working here in the Clinical Division three years now. I can tell you that the girls in the Fecundate Division ''LOVE'' being there. Hell, I've even thought about requesting a transfer myself.@@
</p>
<p>
You think about it for a while. @@.pc;<<has pregnancy>>Well, that actually sounds pretty awesome to be honest!<<or>>Well, I can't dispute how good the pay is, and the girls do seem really happy... but I don't know if I'm ready to be a mother.<</has>>@@
</p>
<p>
She gives you an encouraging smile. @@.npc;It's normal to be nervous before your first pregnancy. You don't have to worry about being a mother though, you'd be a surrogate. That means helping other women who can't have babies, but also that you wouldn't have to worry about taking care of them or being a mother just yet. All the fun of being pregnant, without the work afterward, you know?@@ The nurse looks up at the wall clock. @@.npc;Look, Progenerate isn't going to force you to do this. If you don't want to be pregnant, you just have to quit. I'm sure you can find another job, so think it over, okay?@@
</p>
<p>
You nod meekly @@.pc;Okay.@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse reaches out and starts helping you remove your clothes. @@.npc;As long as you're still here though, we've gotta do this exam, so let's get these clothes off!@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG_FecundateBriefing2]]</center>
<p>
The exam proceeds pretty smoothly; the nurse carefully measures your height and weight, takes your blood pressure, measures your pulse and oxygen saturation. You are also subjected to a breast exam and a visual inspection of some delicate areas. The nurse remains professional the whole time, though, so having your vulva looked at and your breasts squeezed didn't really bother you.
</p>
<p>
Once the exam is done and you're dressed again, the nurse speaks up. @@.npc;You looked quite healthy, miss <<surname>>. All that's left is a quick briefing.@@
</p>
<p>
You remember the receptionist mentioning that. @@.pc;What's the briefing for?@@
</p>
<p>
She gives you a look as if to say "people like ''you'' are the reason we have to give this briefing." @@.npc;To cover some important information that <i>some</i> people seem to miss in their in-processing and paperwork.@@
</p>
<p>
You feel like there isn't much to say to that, so you just nod.
</p>
<p>
She quickly scans the front of a clipboard before she starts. @@.npc;So first of all, you are not allowed to take hormonal birth control or have a contraceptive medical device installed. This would make it difficult for you to conceive, which is sort of the point of working here. It could also be bad for the baby if you're already pregnant. Secondly, you are strictly forbidden from voluntarily terminating a pregnancy while employed in the Fecundate Division. If you do so, you'll be responsible for paying a very large sum of money, and will almost certainly lose your job. Finally, any child you give birth to while employed at Progenerate Technologies GmbH is their property.@@ she pauses for a moment. @@.npc;Do you understand all that?@@
</p>
<p>
You think about it for a moment. @@.pc;No taking birth control, no getting an abortion, and the surrogate babies aren't mine. Got it.@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse stands up. @@.npc;Okay, great job miss <<surname>>, we're all done here. Let me show you back to the waiting room...@@

<p>
<<f y>>ou're in the Clinical Division for one of your regular checkups when the nurse seems to notice something that catches her attention. @@.npc;Huh, that's really unusual...@@ She goes to the shelf and retrieves some sort of vaginal probe. She connects the wire trailing from the end of it to the computer terminal nearby, and has you open your legs on the exam table. Without much kindness she slips the probe into your pussy and starts moving it around to position it according to the instructions on the terminal screen.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG_FecundateBirthConExam2]]</center>
<p>
Perhaps 30 seconds later, the terminal lets out a series of unhappy beeps. The nurse gives you a look that makes it clear that she's disgusted with you, and takes out the probe. @@.npc;Wait here miss <<surname>>, I have to go fetch a doctor.@@
</p>
<p>
You're left naked and alone for several minutes while you wonder what's going on. You sit there naked with your legs still spread before you decide to go ahead and get dressed while you wait. When you look to the spot where you left your clothes, however, you find that they're no longer there. @@.mono;The nurse must've taken them.@@
</p>
<p>
Eventually the nurse returns, only to gesture to the door. @@.npc;Okay miss <<surname>>, we've gotta move to a new room to see the doctor. Right this way please.@@
</p>
<p>
You stand up, still very aware of your nakedness, and follow the nurse into the hallway. The two of you walk past several rooms before she ushers you into a room with an open door. Inside, you see what looks to be a very unusual gynecological exam chair.
</p>
<p>
The nurse points to the chair. @@.npc;Okay, sit in the chair and put your legs up.@@
</p>
<p>
You comply, having had plenty of these sorts of exams lately. You put your legs in the padded stirrups and wait. @@.pc;What's going on?@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse moves over to the side of the chair. @@.npc;The doctor will explain when she gets here. For now let's get you ready, okay?@@ The nurse starts positioning one arm, raising it above your head and letting you grab onto a handle before starting on the other arm.
</p>
<p>
All of a sudden you realize that she's strapping you in, and you can't move either of your arms. @@.pc;Hey! What're you doing?@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse sighs as she starts fastening a strap over your chest. @@.npc;It's required for the procedure. Just be patient until the doctor arrives.@@ She keeps strapping you in, and before you know it you're completely immobilized in the exam chair.
</p>
<p>
The nurse moves over to some cabinets and starts retrieving a few items, placing them on a surgical tray. She brings the tray over and places it on a stand next to the chair. The tray has a speculum as well as some lubricant, <<if _iud>>as well as a couple plyer-like devices you don't recognize<<else>>as well as some syringes with long needles<</if>>.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG_FecundateBirthCon]]</center>

The nurse is just finishing up when the doctor walks in. @@.npc;So this is our naughty girl then?@@

<p>
The nurse nods. @@.npc;Yes doctor, the scan made it clear that <<if _iud>>she has an IUD installed<<else>>she is on hormonal birth control<</if>>.@@

With the painful procedure finally over, the doctor stands up and pulls off her gloves. @@.npc;Whatever the reason, miss <<surname>>, I wouldn't let this happen again.

The effects of the special douche already have you heavily aroused, so the massage feels intensely pleasurable. @@.pc;Mmm, that's nice...@@ Despite the pleasure, you're still curious. @@.pc;What is this for exactly?@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse doesn't stop rubbing your clit with practiced strokes. @@.npc;First of all, having an orgasm will help the douche liquid to open your cervix. Secondly, when a woman has an orgasm it causes rhythmic muscle action in your abdomen and uterus that lasts for a few hours afterward. These motions help draw semen into the uterus and then push it into the fallopian tube connected to the ovary that will ovulate next. Basically, it makes it easier for you to get pregnant.@@
</p>
<<else>>
<p>
You already feel very aroused, courtesy of the special douche, so when the nurse starts stroking your clit it's extremely pleasurable. @@.pc;Mmmmm that's good.@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse chuckles lightly but doesn't stop rubbing your sensitive pleasure nub.
</p>
<</if>>
<p>
The massage goes on for a few minutes, the pleasure growing more and more intense as tension seems to build in your womb. You're distinctly aware of a strong craving to have your pussy filled, but the nurse just continues to massage your clit. The whole time she has been massaging you, she has slowly increased the speed of her motion and the pressure of her finger against your delicate flesh. You let out a quiet moan and grip the armrests as the tension reaches the breaking point.
</p>
<p>
The nurse increases her stimulation further, and suddenly your pleasure crests to a climax. You spasm lightly, your pussy trying to clamp down on a non-existent partner as your body shakes with pleasure. It takes you a few moments to recover your senses, but when you do you notice that the Nurse is no longer massaging you.
</p>
<p>
You open your eyes, and see her smiling down at you. @@.npc;How was that, are you ready for the next step?@@
</p>
<p>
You nod and answer @@.pc;yes@@ in a shaky voice.
</p>
<p>
The nurse takes a few steps and sits down on a medical stool before rolling herself between your legs. @@.npc;Okay miss <<surname>>, next I'm going to open you up with a special kind of funnel. I know you just came, but please try to avoid clamping down on it, okay?@@
</p>
<p>
You manage to say @@.pc;I'll do my best@@ as you continue to recover from your orgasm.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG_FecundateSpeculum]]</center>
<p>
You feel something enter your wet pussy. @@.npc;Okay dear, I'm going to start pushing this in, and then we'll almost be ready for the insemination. There's a camera and light attached to it, so you can watch on the monitor if you'd like.@@ She lifts a hand to point at a large monitor attached to the wall next to you.
</p>
<p>
You watch on the monitor as the plastic tube-like thing seems to slide into a dark-red tunnel, it's a bit surreal because your pussy feels every inch. Suddenly a pink circle of flesh comes into view, and the tube stops advancing. You can see a dark hole in the middle of it leading to your womb. @@.mono;That's my cervix... that douche really opened it up!@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse does something to fix the tube in place. @@.npc;We don't go all the way to your cervix because we want to leave room for your body to ingest the semen naturally. It could cause problems if we forced too much semen into your uterus on accident, after all.@@
</p>
<p>
You hear the nurse roll the stool as you continue to watch the monitor. Now that the funnel is fixed in place, you can see your cervix come in and out of view, it's almost as if it's searching for fresh cum to drink.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Okay, I'm going to tilt the chair backwards now, so don't be alarmed. We want to make sure the semen goes in the right direction.@@ There's a light clunk sound followed by the whir of an electric motor. Slowly the chair--stirrups and all--rotates backward so that your crotch is pointed more upward.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully you can still see the monitor from your new position, and you watch as you hear the nurse getting ready for what comes next.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Okay, this is it! I'm going to start pouring in the semen now. I'm going to take it slow, this way your womb can ingest the semen without trapped air or bubbles getting in the way.@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-FecundateInsemination]]</center>
<p>
Trickles and clumps of thick semen suddenly appear on the monitor as the drop into the funnel and make their way toward your cervix. @@.pc;Ooh, it's warm!@@
</p>
<p>
You can hear the nurse chuckle before she answers. @@.npc;That's right. We find that keeping little details like that as accurate as possible can help the odds of success.@@
</p>
<p>
You stare, entranced, as more and more semen slowly trickles into you. It doesn't seem to be filling your pussy up, however. Instead, your body seems to be allowing most of it to travel into your womb. It takes more than a minute of the slow trickle before you start to see pearly-white semen start to puddle in your vagina. Eventually all you can see at the base of the funnel is white cum.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Okay, it seems like that's enough. We'll leave the funnel in there while we let it settle.@@ You can hear the nurse's stool roll away. @@.npc;We just need to give that a couple more minutes, and then I'll take out the funnel and insert your cervical cap.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Okay.@@ With little else to do, you watch the monitor as you wait. It'd be hard to tell at a glance, but you can see the pool of cum slowly recede. By the time the nurse returns, a third of your cervix is visible once more.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Ooh, it looks like your womb was hungry dear, good job!@@ You hear some crinkling plastic. @@.npc;Okay, I'm going to pull out the funnel and then insert this temporary cervical cap right afterward. It's a bit like a small diaphragm that's held in place with special glue. It's going to hold the semen in place until your cervix tightens back up and your body absorbs most of the extra liquid.@@
</p>
<p>
You look away from the monitor as you see the funnel suddenly start to rush backward. As soon as the funnel is out of you, you feel another piece of plastic slide inside. This one presses firmly against your cervix, but it isn't uncomfortable. It's only inside you for a few seconds before it's removed.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Okay miss <<surname>>, we're all done. That cervical cap will dissolve on it's own in a couple days, so don't try to remove it. I'm going to put your chair back up now.@@ You hear a familiar clunk along with the whirring of an electric motor as your chair slowly makes it back to the upright position.
</p>
<p>
Once you're sitting upright, the nurse gives you a bright and encouraging smile. @@.npc;You did great, <<name>><<if _first>>.<<else>> like always.<</if>>@@ She holds your hand and helps you out of the chair. @@.npc;You can go ahead and get dressed now, I've got to start getting ready for the next patient.@@

The zygote is what happens when your egg starts dividing into more cells. When the zygote implants in the wall of your uterus, you're pregnant.@@

<p>
You nod along as she talks, the Fecundate Division training covered this a couple times already.

@@.npc;So sometimes the zygote splits into two zygotes before they implant. This is how identical twins happen. That's where Saradberol comes in. When you get treated with it, it dramatically increases the chances of each zygote splitting before they implant.

The nurse is quick and efficient about taking your vitals, and checking some basic markers for your pregnancy. @@.npc;Now that you're pregnant, it's time to give you your acceleration treatment.@@
</p>
<p>
You aren't sure how you feel about pregnancy acceleration. @@.pc;Well, it feels like a shame to have the pregnancy end quicker than it needs to, but I suppose it also means more babies...@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse shrugs. @@.npc;Sorry Miss <<surname>>, it's company policy to accelerate all pregnancies. I've got to give you the treatment.@@
</p>

You stand in front of the nurse and she carefully injects you with a cocktail of gestation accelerants. @@.npc;You're all set! You can go ahead and get dressed.@@

<p>
<<f y>>ou make your way to the Clinical Division for the rather ominous-sounding "Vaginal Stretching" appointment. You spend several minutes in the waiting room browsing Twatter with your phone before the nurse arrives to take you back to an exam room.
</p>
<p>
The exam covers all the basic measurements that you've become accustomed to, and the nurse gets them done with practiced ease. After she's finished checking on your unborn children, she has you lay on your side. @@.npc;I'm sorry, I know the stretching isn't the most pleasant procedure, but it'll make giving birth so much easier.@@ She pats your tummy gently. @@.npc;With multiple pregnancies the birthing takes longer. We want you to be healthy and avoid needing a C-section, so that's why we do these stretching sessions.@@
</p>
<p>
<<if _first>>
You nod, having already resolved yourself to get the procedure over with. @@.pc;I know... the stretching isn't great, but I've heard a lot about the toll a C-section has on your womb, so...@@
<<else>>
You nod, knowing what to expect from previous sessions. @@.pc;This isn't my first session, so I know I'd rather do this than have a C-section!@@
<</if>>
</p>
<p>
The nurse gives you an encouraging smile. @@.npc;That's right, you definitely don't want a C-section if you can avoid it.@@ The nurse positions your legs so she has easy access to your pussy. @@.npc;Okay, we're gonna start with getting you all nice and lubed up. Then I'll be doing a little manual stimulation for you.@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-PregnantExam2]]</center>
<<if _first>>
<p>
@@.pc;Manual stimulation? What's that about?@@
</p>
<p>
The nurse explains as she works. @@.npc;You see, arousal improves blood flow to the vagina, which improves the effectiveness of the procedure. More importantly though, being aroused will make the stretching easier and less uncomfortable for you.@@
</p>
<<else>>
You smile. @@.pc;At least this part is enjoyable.@@
<</if>>
<p>
The nurse takes several minutes to gently rub your clit after slathering you with lube, and by the time she's finished your own arousal has left your cunt literally dripping. @@.npc;Okay, now it's time for the stretching... be a dear and climb up on all fours, okay?@@ As you reposition yourself you hear the door open. @@.npc;Okay Joe, we're ready for you.@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG_FecundateStretch]]</center>
<p>
Joe takes his time working increasingly large dildo-like stretching devices into your pussy. At first it's just a pleasant filling sensation, but each transition to the next size makes you feel more and more stuffed. Eventually you reach a size that seems to be the largest that could fit... and that's when Joe grabs the next-larger size. @@.npc;Okay girl, now it's time for the stretching. Just hang in there.@@
</p>
<p>
You feel the overly large device start to push its way into your pussy. @@.pc;Haaaahn!@@ you moan despite yourself. The slight pain of being stretched beyond your limits <<if _first>>is surprisingly arousing.<<else>>always feels better than you expect.<</if>>
</p>
<p>
Once the device is lodged against your cervix, you hear Joe step back. @@.npc;Okay, I think you've got it from here.@@ The nurse speaks up. @@.npc;Thanks Joe, I always have a hard time getting that last size in there.@@ You hear the door open and close once more, and then the nurse comes back to stand at your side. @@.npc;Okay dear, <<if _first>>we've gotta let the device stay like that for 15 minutes so that the stretching will stick.<<else>>you know the drill already, 15 minutes while your vagina settles.<</if>> Don't worry, I'll stay here with you.@@
