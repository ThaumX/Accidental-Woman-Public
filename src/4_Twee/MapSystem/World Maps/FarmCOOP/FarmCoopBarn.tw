<p>@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing in "The Barn", a sort of recreation and community center. It has a rustic feel to it, and is dominated by a large open area filled with various arrangements of couches, tables, and chairs. One corner has a collection of game equipment like pool tables and dart boards, while another consists of a dining area that has a concessions window. You can spot a small milking bay for hucows too busy having fun to make it to the dairy. You also notice that some of the furniture in the room seems to have a more sexual purpose, not that that stops the girls from fooling around with each other wherever they happen to be sitting. A rustic wooden staircase leads upstairs where there seem to be more individual rooms rather than a large open area.</p>
