    <p>[This is a placeholder text for the game end. It will be expanded and possibly rewritten in next releases!]</p>
    <p>Rejuvenator hums as Lily pressing buttons. You feel weird but this time it is expected. Before you lose your consciousness you smile...</p>
    <p>You wake up. Everything changed once again. You breathe differently, your heart beats differently, your skin feels brand new. Although, this time sickness is much less strong, just a little dizziness... You open your eyes and blink to adjust. Your brain slowly remembers on how to deal with your old body. Carefully, you sit up and look at yourself. It looks like you reverted back to your old self.</p>
    <p>You are still looking at your hands when the door creaks and a person comes to the basement. It takes you another moment to focus on Lily. @@.pc;Hi...@@ You notice that your voice became much lower and hoarse, it is a familiar male voice now. You clear your throat. @@.pc;Did it go well?@@</p>
    <p>Lily smiles. @@.npc;It certainly did! I made some tests while you were sleeping, it seems you are absolutely okay, I was worrying you won't revert back fully but... how are you feeling?@@ It takes you a moment thinking. @@.pc;Surprisingly male.@@ You smile awkwardly and Lily smiles back blushing for some reason. @@.npc;I'll... bring your old clothes from upstairs. I saved your stuff in case you know...@@ You nod only to realize that you are totally naked and your cock enjoys its newly acquired existence to its fullest. @@.pc;Oh.@@ You cover yourself with hands and Lily giggles. @@.npc;I'll take it as a compliment to my work, tee-hee! Be right back, rest here a bit!@@ She walks out and you sigh reflecting on your female adventure. @@.mono;Now I can probably leave the valley... Or should I try to find my place here as a male?@@ There are so many options now. It was a long and weird time.</p>
    <p>But everything is normal once again.</p>
