<<f t>>oday when you walk into your Jobbing 101 classroom, you notice some boxes of supplies sitting on the teacher's desk. @@.mono;I wonder what we're going to learn today?@@
</p>
<p>
The instructor walks in the door and immediately starts the class. @@.npc;Today we're going to talk about organization.@@ He looks over the faces of the students before continuing. @@.npc;Organization can make a big difference in business; it can increase profits and reduce risk, sure, but as an employee it could also help keep you safe.@@
</p>
<p>
He walked over to his desk before continuing. @@.npc;Here at the oldest profession, we believe in teaching through example. Today, we're going to do an exercise to put your organization skills to work.@@ He starts unpacking the boxes of supplies as he continues. @@.npc;Smuggling provides us with a good example of how big a difference organization can have. How much product can a single courier fit inside them? Couldn't better organization and packaging of the product increase efficiency? Would you want to transport some unorganized packages of product inside yourself?@@
</p>
<p>
One of your classmates speaks up to answer the rhetorical question. @@.npd;Hell no! I knew a guy who tried to sneak some Satyr into school, but he used one of those made-to-break hex condoms. The dude's dick seriously exploded in the middle of class!@@
</p>
<p>
The instructor nods, not upset at the unsolicited answer. @@.npc;That's right Santiago, organization is important!@@ He gestures to the supplies on his desk. @@.npc;Today's exercise will be organizing some packages of substitute product--powdered radish--for you to carry. This will also serve as some bonus training in rectum storage. There will be a reward for the student who is able to effectively organize their package to carry the largest amount of product.@@ He gives the class a wide-eyed grin. @@.npc;Take this exercise seriously, folks, that powder is gonna light a fire in your ass if you screw up!@@

The rest of the lesson proceeds rather quickly as you ''very carefully'' use the techniques you've learned to make a nice and organized smuggling suppository.

You decided to try and win the challenge to carry the most product, you figured your well-used back door would give you an advantage in holding a larger package. Unfortunately that bitch Karen was able to stuff a larger package up her ass.

You decided to try and win the challenge to carry the most product. Thanks to your cavernous asshole, you were able to carry a monster-sized package. You even managed to beat that ass whore Karen.

You are sitting in another lecture in your Jobbing 101 class, this one focused on finance. It's really something of a combination of basic math, basic accounting, and basic economics with some... <i>interesting</i> examples. You have to admit, without the examples, this class would be far too dull to stay awake.
</p>
<p>
The instructor looked around the class. @@.npc;Okay, let's do a practical example, shall we?@@ he turns to the white board to start writing the problem as he explains it. @@.npc;You are able to procure 100 grams of pure product from your supplier for 1,350 credits. It will cost you 1 credit per gram in distribution costs, 100 credits to sell the whole batch. Finally, you can sell the product to the customer at 15 credits per gram.@@ He turns back to the class. @@.npc;D-Bone, what is your net profit for each gram sold?@@
</p>
<p>
D-Bone takes his time to add the listed costs before dividing by 100. You see his lips and fingers moving briefly as he calculates. @@.npe;Yo, that's only half a cred per gram!@@
</p>
<p>
The instructor smiles at D-Bone. @@.npc;That's right, good job! As you can see, 50 credits isn't much profit on a whole 100 grams of product! So let's see what happens if we cut the product by 20 percent so we have a total of 125 grams of product. Remember folks, even though we add 25 grams, which is 25 percent of 100, the 100 grams of product makes 80 percent of 125 grams. That means it's 20% filler.@@
</p>
<p>
He shows his math on the board for the class. @@.npc;Remember, because we're selling 125 grams of product now, our total distribution costs are 125 credits, not 100. We arrive at a total net profit of 400 credits, which is 3.2 credits per gram.@@ He turns around and smiles at the class. @@.npc;Now that's a little more like it, isn't it?@@ He looks up at the clock on the wall. @@.npc;It seems that's about all we have time for now.

Something I'm sure you could manage if you put your mind to it, <<name>>. This woman managed to smuggle this gun into a prison and shoot the competing company's boss.

The instructor looks back at the image before answering. @@.npc;Oh, these are Japanese prostitutes. The prostitution laws there are extremely open, while it remains heavily restricted in the U.S, so they just made for a better example.@@ He pauses for a moment, as if to figure out where to resume the lesson. @@.npc;Anyway, prostitution can have a lot of potential downsides for the customer. By organizing and creating a brand identity, customers can recommend friends to try out the "Nakadashi Ichiban".

The instructor, Mr. Patoulli, stands at the front of the classroom. He's a short and pudgy man, the baldness on top of his head made even more obvious by the thick hair on the sides. If it wasn't for his supposed connections to organized crime most of the class would probably walk out once it was revealed that there was going to be another finance lesson. Still, he does seem to know what he's doing, as distasteful as he might otherwise be.

The instructor carries on, used to Karen's bimbo antics by this point. @@.npc;So there you are, trapped, helpless, with a big throbbing cock in front of you. Obviously this is a dangerous situation.

So then, put your problem-solving skills to use. What do you do?@@
</p>
<p>
Karen raises her hand, waiving it violently back and forth in an attempt to get the instructor's attention. Eventually he acquiesces, calling on her. @@.npd;Umm, isn't it obvious? Suck that cock! Suck it like it's the last, who knows, maybe that psycho will kill you and it will be!@@
</p>
<p>
The instructor sighs. @@.npc;Yes, pleasing your captor is probably a good move, but not just because you want to suck a cock like Karen here. Being cooperative can aid you in a number of ways, such as causing your temporary owner to let his guard down. It will also reduce the likelihood of immediate reprisal for bad behavior, leaving you in better shape for a possible escape attempt later on.@@
</p>
<p>
Karen pouts, but the instructor ignores her as he continues. @@.npc;It's important to remember to treat your captivity as a problem that can be solved. Rather than giving up hope and wallowing in despair, pay close attention to everything around you. Any number of things could help enable your escape, as long as you take the time to be aware of them.@@ He pauses as a contraption is wheeled into the classroom. @@.npc;Okay then, it's time for a practical lesson!@@

After fixing the device at the front of the classroom, and retrieving some rope, he began to explain the exercise. @@.npc;To put you under some pressure, we're going to attach you to this bondage apparatus.

You trudge into the classroom for yet another Freakonomics lesson. Despite the fun name, the course is actually very boring. Of course, that's what you'd expect from a class on economics, even if it has been spiced up with lessons about cooking the books or laundering money.

Mr. Patoulli shakes his head. @@.npc;No, no, no. You use them to add and subtract numbers, just like a normal calculator. The tape keeps a record of what you do on the calculator, making it easier to find a number again or catch mistakes.@@ He raises his hands, as if to ward off complaints. @@.npc;Yes, I know any computer, phone, or tablet can do the same thing. But what if you need to do accounting work that has to be kept absolutely secret, say for a criminal organization.

The school is functionally Catholic, so all the girls end up pregnant regardless.
