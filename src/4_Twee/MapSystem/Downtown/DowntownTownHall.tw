<<f y>>ou spend a little time looking around the large townhall building. Eventually you decide to take a walk through the building to see what's inside. Passing down the main first-floor corridor, you notice a few waiting areas. You wonder at the possibility of some documents getting scooped up with the magazines, and sort through the piles in each area. You leave the magazines neater than when you started, so you don't draw any attention as you continue your search. You decide that you ran out of luck once you finished stacking up the magazines in a small waiting chamber at the end of the hall. You turn to leave, but accidentally undo some of your work and knock a magazine to the floor. As you bend down to pick it up, you notice a familiar sight under the bureau that the magazines are sitting on. <<link "Pick it up">><<pickup "$items" "Gene Therapy 03">><<run Dialog.close()>><<run UI.alert("You pick up the paper documents")>><</link>>.

<<f i>>n the small waiting room of the RAPES office there is little indication that anyone actually works here. You walk over to a small "take a number" kiosk and learn that you are number J37. After that you take a seat in one of the bland and mildly-uncomfortable seats. Every so often someone exits the door opposite your seat and a new number flashes up on a small LED screen on the wall, accompanied by a mechanical voice calling the new number. You see <<link "some booklets">><<dialog "Booklets">><center>[img[IMG-Advert-Thornton]]<br>[img[IMG-Advert-Maid]]<br></center><</dialog>><</link>>on the little wobbly table.

<<f a>>fter what feels like an eternity of sitting in the waiting room, your number is finally called. You make your way over to the office door that the last person stepped out of, and open it. You're met with a tiny office and no sign of a RAPES employee. Instead there's a cheap desk, with a simple and rather outdated terminal on top. An swivel office chair that's seen better days is the only other piece of furniture.

<<f s>>itting down at the desk, you notice a small sign underneath the discolored plastic of the terminal. It says "Follow the instructions to log in to the RAPES Computer User Management terminal. Select a job you are interested in, and follow the instructions to apply." the old terminal is displaying a log-in screen, requesting you to scan a finger print and hold your eye open for a retina scan. There are helpful diagrams explaining what to do, so you probably would be able to figure it out without being able to read.

The other you use to stroke his cock in time with the movement of your mouth. When you judge that he is aroused enough, you remove your hand and begin to deep throat him. The intense sensation of your throat stretching around his cockhead proves to be effective, it isn't long before you feel the sudden swelling of his rod that means orgasm is imminent. You pick up the pace, and soon after he sends the first spray of cum directly down your esophagus. You pull back, sucking firmly as he unloads the rest of his jizz into your mouth. You let him rest for a moment, and then use your hand to milk the final dregs of his load into your mouth. Only then do you release his member, looking up and opening your mouth to show off you harvest before you swallow it all. @@.pc;Yum!@@
