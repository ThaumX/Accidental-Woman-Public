<p>@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing in front of a large warehouse building that has several loading bays on one side. Some are occupied by trucks, but most are currently empty. Off to the side you see a large grain elevator and several silos. It seems the Farm Coop uses this area to consolidate harvests for better prices. There isn't a lot of visible activity going on right now, though you get the feeling you aren't really supposed to be wandering around over here.</p>
