<span class='ship' style='font-size:1.15rem;'>W</span>ork focus represents what goals you are focusing on during your shift at work. While you may not have any particular focus (none), you may be interested in improving your reputation, skills, or just performing better. Here you can choose one of several focuses for the day at work. Note that choosing a focus has an effect on your work performance as well. Some will make it easier to accomplish tasks successfully, while others will make it more difficult. Similarly, your work effort will affect how beneficial your focus is.<br>
<dl class="headl">
<dt>None</dt><dd>No particular focus for the day, generally just getting things done. Has no bonuses or penalties.</dd>
<dt>Working</dt><dd>Put extra focus into getting your work done properly. Gives a bonus to your task skill checks at the cost of 5% to 15% more stress for the day. Useful if you are having a hard time completing tasks successfully, or for improving your performance rating.</dd>
<dt>Skill</dt><dd>Focusing on improving your work skills. Can give additional chances to level up a work skill, and a small bonus to completing tasks. It also causes from 5% to 15% additional stress for the day. Useful to help level up work skills faster.</dd>
<dt>Boss</dt><dd>Focus on pleasing the boss. Not exactly brown-nosing--at least if done properly--it's more about making sure your contributions are recognized. This can help improve your relationship with your boss, and potentially even give a small bonus towards promotion progress. It has a small chance of backfiring. May apply a moderate bonus or penalty to task completion for the day.</dd>
<dt>Coworkers</dt><dd>Focus on improving your relationship with your coworkers. Coworkers make a noticeable difference to your overall performance and promotion potential, either positive or negative, so improving relationships can be valuable. Spending time on office gossip and politics comes at a cost of a penalty to task completion.</dd>
<dt>Subordinates</dt><dd>Focus on mentoring and improving your relationship with your subordinates. Because you are responsible for them, your subordinates can have a significant effect on your overall performance rating and promotion potential. Choosing this focus has a varying impact to task completion, and could be either a small benefit or penalty. <i>Note: this focus is only available once you have subordinates.</i></dd>

<span class='ship' style='font-size:1.15rem;'>W</span>ork effort represents... surprise,the amount of effort you're putting into work. This affects both your ability to complete tasks, as well as the benefits gained from any focus you choose. It also influences the amount of stress gained from working. Working hard results in increased stress, which explains a lot about <span class="megrim"><b><span class="ship">T</span>haum<span class="ship">X</span></b></span> when you think about it...

<<f i>>n a moment of clarity or foolishness--you aren't sure which yet--you decide to quit your job. It's not like you have another job lined up or anything... you just don't want to work here anymore. Not wanting to actually tell your boss in person, you make your way to a quiet area and fire up your SnatchChat app. You aren't sure how the trend got started, or if stripping nude for the photo will <i>really</i> make suddenly quitting go over any better. That doesn't stop you from stripping naked and squatting for a selfie though. After getting dressed and appending a simple "I Quit!" message, you send it to your boss and coworkers.
