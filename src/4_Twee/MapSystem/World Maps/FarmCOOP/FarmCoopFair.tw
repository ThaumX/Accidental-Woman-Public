You approach the shooting range at the northern part of the fair.

Shots are pretty loud here, the woman who rules the range almost shouting so you could hear her. @@.mono;Or maybe she just went deaf after too much time spent on the range?@@

  <p>Guy turns to you while the crowd around starts applauding and cheering you up. @@.npc;Very good! Well, remember the rules and start as soon as you are ready, miss! If you succeed you'll get a little prize! Come on, folk, let's encourage our brave girl!@@</p>
  <p>Following his inviting gesture you come closer to Ace. His semi-erect veiny cock is hanging freely a pair of peach-sized balls are resting just behind it. With a sigh of anticipation you kneel before the massive dong and hear the crowd goes insane, whistling supporting you. You take Ace's baseball bat in both hands and lift it to align with your mouth. Kissing the tip gently you get  another burst of applause from behind and a sharp distinctive taste in your mouth. Taking the head turns out harder than you expected though. Opening your jaw as wide as you can you manage, you engulf the stallions cock and Ace snorts, his cock gets stiffer in your mouth. With cautious motions you suck him feeling his helmet hitting the back of your throat. Stallion's legs start moving nervously but guy holds him by the leash.</p>

	<p>You gain a pace and can't hear a thing anymore besides slurping of your saliva while you force yourself on Ace's meatstick. There is nothing except this giant cock and you in the whole world. Captured by a true cocksucker's bliss you do your blow job furiously and to your big surprise, you suddenly manage to deepthroat the beast. Your eyes water and you feel like your throat is stretched painfully when his well-lubricated cock slides down. @@.mono;Ooommhmh! oh... oh... oh yeaaah! I am a blowjob queen, fuckers!@@ You move back a little to get a little air and try deepthroating him again which feels easier now. Frantically working you almost miss the guy's voice informing you that you have only 3 minutes left to make your lover cum. Full of determination you cup his giant meaty balls with your both hands and pick up the pace letting the horse fuck your wide-open throat. Ace neighs and helps you by rhythmically pushing his meat even further. You are already almost suffocated when his cock becomes even harder than it was pulsing inside your throat. Afraid of drowning, you back a bit just in time for accepting his whole load into your mouth. The thick horse semen has a stronger odor and an incredibly good taste. You keep licking his head until the last splash of his cum leaves his member and turn to the crowd to show your bounty. Opening your mouth you show them a mouthful of Ace semen and without any second thought gulp it down smiling innocently feeling like a total blissful slut. The audience gets insane and you see a couple of people mindlessly play with their hands inside their underwear.</p>
	<p>@@.npc;Oh my! What a brave talented girl we have here! I conduct this competition for 6 years now and have never seen anybody taking so much horse cock! I am sure we have a winner, ladies, and gentlemen! Your applause to Miss <<= â†‚.pc.main.name>>!@@</p>
	<p>You can barely stay and it takes about ten minutes to get yourself together before you are ready to get your prize. It is a little golden dog tag with 'Best horse fluffer 2032' text and you feel as proud as possible. The guy lets you go only after getting sure you will be okay.</p>
	<p>@@.mono;Oh my, this was a hell of an experience! Totally worth visiting this fair!@@</p>

	<p>You gain a pace and can't hear a thing anymore besides slurping of your saliva while you force yourself on Ace's meatstick. There is nothing except this giant cock and you in a whole world. Although it is not that easy. Ace's cock is enormous and you can barely impale yourself on it. Working with your tongue you polish his head in your mouth, the taste is awesome and despite your understanding that you won't be able to make him cum you have tons of fun playing with such equipment and by the crowds happy cheering. When your time ends you are almost sorry to leave this piece of art.
