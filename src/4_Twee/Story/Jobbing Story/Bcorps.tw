<p>
Two women in SPURT containment suits walk down an underground hallway. The video is nearly silent, the camera angle looking down at the women from the ceiling. The tight fabric of the suits clings to their bodies and does very little to hide their voluptuous figures and large breasts. Labels appear on the screen underneath the women. The one labeled Sergeant Anita Wang has black hair peeking out of a hair cap and tan skin. The one labeled Private Sharen Jones has shortly-styled blonde hair with fair skin.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, audio interrupts the silence of the video. @@.npe;Sergeant Wang, we need you to take your squad and report immediately to the project ops center in F-7.@@ The dialog is accompanied by subtitles at the bottom of the video, helpfully labeled as "CONTROL".

Wang makes a 'follow me' gesture to Jones and begins to jog back the way she came. @@.npc;Thanks for the extra info Control. We'll follow standard recon protocol and let you know what's going on as soon as we can. Sergeant Wang, out.@@
</p>
<p>
The view shifts to a new camera as the two women jog down the corridor; their containment suits fail to stop their breasts from bouncing in time with their steps.
</p>

<p>
@@.npc;Hurry up Jones, we've gotta make it to F-7! Control lost contact with Alpha Squad over three hours ago!@@

<p>
Jones sounds surprised as she speaks for the first time in the video. @@.npd;Wait just a sec Sarge... F-7 is where they've been working on Project Seedbed! We need some real guns!@@ You hear the rush of air as she takes another deep breath to keep up with the exertion. @@.npd;Not just guns, either, Sarge. We NEED the rest of the squad.@@
</p>
<p>
Wang shakes her head inside her helmet. @@.npc;Sorry, orders are orders.

We won't be able to report on suit radios until we're out again. We might not have enough time if we go back to get the rest of the squad and wait while everyone gears up.@@
</p>
<p>
Private Jones waves what looks like a gun with a large red crystal lens instead of a barrel at Sergeant Wang. @@.npd;This stun carbine isn't going to do jack against whatever crazy shit they've got in there! Let's at least detour to an armory!@@
</p>
<p>
The sergeant's voice takes on an angry edge. @@.npc;For the last time, Private, you know the Captain's standing orders. Stun only without her express fucking authorization, got it?!@@
</p>
<p>
There's a brief silence before Jones answers sullenly. @@.npd;I got it, Sarge.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Look, don't worry. I've got my service pistol. If we see any of your 'crazy shit' we'll turn around immediately to report.@@
</p>
<p>
The two continue jogging for some time, the camera view occasionally changing to new ones to keep up with them. Eventually the pair arrive at a large bulkhead door labeled F-7. Sergeant Wang holds a small golden rod next to a door sensor, and after several moments a red beacon lights up the corridor. The heavy duty door splits down the middle, each side slowly retracting into the wall. The portal leads to another nondescript corridor, this one dimly lit by emergency lighting.
</p>
<p>
Wang steps through the door before looking back at Jones. @@.npc;Come on Jones, let's get this over with. Stay sharp.@@
</p>
<p>
Jones follows after her. @@.npd;You don't have to tell ''me'' twice, Sarge.@@
</p>
<p>
The pair make their way down a twisting series of corridors, guided by Sergeant Wang using a map display on her suit's forearm armor. The project ops center is unfortunately located near the middle of the facility, so the two maintain a quick pace.
</p>
<p>
After several minutes the pair arrive at a section of corridor that seems to have been damaged. Some of the panels have fallen away, exposing some of the pipes and conduit underneath. @@.npd;I wonder what caused this?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Come on, let's not hang around to find out.@@ Paying close attention to a dark opening in the corridor wall, Sergeant Jones eases past some of the fallen wall panels. She waits for Jones to make it past as well before resuming a fast walk toward the center of the facility.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, a loud metallic bang echoes though the corridor as a air vent cover falls to the floor. @@.npc;AAAAAHHHHH!@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam2]]</center>
<p>
A large cluster of vine-like things has emerged from the vent and seized Wang's arm, who yells in a panicked voice. @@.npc;Holy shit! It came out of the fucking air vent! It got my gun arm too, shit!@@ The mass of vines wrenches her arm upward, leaving her slightly off balance as she struggles to regain her footing.
</p>
<p>
@@.npd;Fuck Sarge!@@ Jones takes careful aim with her carbine and unleashes a series of electric pulses into the largest cluster of vines, which seem to ignore the pulses completely.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the vines have managed to engulf most of Sergeant Wang's arm, pulling her whole body upward until she's forced to balance on the tips of her toes. @@.npc;I can't get my arm free, its grip is too damn strong. Jones, you've gotta leave me and get to the control room. It's our only hope! Now GO!@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam3]]</center>
<p>
Jones looks around in a panic as the vines continue to wrap around Wang. @@.npd;But Sarge...@@
</p>
<p>
Having been lifted into the air, Sergeant Wang suddenly feels a warm wet sensation against the smooth skin of her breasts. The tentacles have somehow created holes in the chest of her containment suit, slipping inside to explore the delicate flesh within. @@.npc;This thing is breaching my containment suit! SHIT! How the hell is it getting through the armor so easily?@@ A thick tentacle, tipped with an obviously-phallic head pushes its way between Wang's struggling legs, rubbing against her vulva in the process. @@.npc;Oh my God, what is it doing?! Is that a plant cock?!@@
</p>
<p>
Sergeant Wang doesn't have long to wonder, the vines roughly yanking the rest of her body up into a horizontal position. Several tentacles have penetrated her suit by this point, some having pushed their way out into her clear polycarbonate helmet to rub against her face.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam4]]</center>
<p>
The cock-like tentacle, a precum-like fluid dribbling from its flared tip, suddenly shoves against Wang's vulva. The material of her suit is stretched as the tentacle attempts to thrust directly into her pussy. Suddenly the material seems to give way, the monstrous cock slamming several inches inside her. @@.npc;Ahhn!!!@@ She releases a surprised moan at the sudden stimulation. @@.npc;Oh my god... it's inside me! How... How is it penetrating the suit?!@@
</p>
<p>
Releasing the golden object in her hand to clatter onto the floor, Anita does her best to fix her eyes on Private Jones. @@.npc;Jones... Take the Omni Override Key. Just get out of here! You've got to keep it from escaping!@@ The plant cock inside her pussy begins to thrust, making an obscene squelching noise. Wang's mouth opens in surprise, and one of the tentacles writhing inside her helmet takes the opportunity to bury itself in her mouth.
</p>
<p>
Mumbling to herself, @@.npd;gotta get the key, gotta get the key, gotta get the key,@@ Jones gets down on her hands and knees. She starts crawling toward the golden omni key on the floor, trying to stay as far from the writhing tentacles above as possible. She's nearly able to reach it when she's startled by a loud metallic impact next to her. Forcing herself to look, she see's the Sergeant's sidearm laying on the corridor floor where the tentacles dropped it.
</p>
<p>
She quickly grabs the firearm, doing her best to ignore the increasingly moan-like gurgling noises coming in through her suit radio. Holding onto the pistol tightly, she stretches her arm forward and grabs the omni key. She begins to back away--just in time--as a small deluge of semen splatters onto the floor in front of her. Continuing to back away, she looks up to see the thick plant cock doing its best to give Sergeant Wang a belly-swelling creampie.
</p>
<p>
Jones climbs to her feet, taking one last look at her superior. @@.npd;I'm sorry... I'm so sorry.@@ She sprints down the corridor, away from Anita Wang and deeper into the facility. She runs that way for nearly a minute--making a couple turns at random along the way--before she's able to get ahold of herself and stop. She takes several deep breaths, partly to sate her need for oxygen after running, and partly to try and force herself to calm down further. @@.npd;<i>Okay Sharen, THINK.</i>@@
</p>
<p>
Duty is mostly forgotten as self preservation takes center stage in the young private's mind. @@.npd;<i>I don't want that to happen to me... If I try to go back the way we came I'll have to pass those tentacles... The control room should have some sort of emergency containment system... maybe a gas or herbicide or something...</i>@@ She looks down at the gold omni key in her left hand. @@.npd;Fuuuuck Sarge. I'll go to the control room.@@
</p>
<p>
Jones takes a few moments to get her bearings using the nav display on her left forarm before setting out toward the control room. She starts out backtracking to the last intersection she passed, taking another corridor leading toward the heart of the facility. It takes another couple minutes of walking, but she manages to arrive at a large set of what appear to be blast doors. @@.npd;<i>What's with these doors? I guess they wanted the control room protected, according to the map it's on the other side of this next room.</i>@@
</p>
<p>
Using the golden key, she enables the door controls and pushes the large 'open' button. She waits impatiently as the blast doors slowly grind open, waiting for them to finish moving before stepping through into the large dimly-lit chamber beyond. She begins to scan the room, looking for the door to the control room--and more importantly--any of the tentacle vines. She spots the door she's looking for on the other side of the room as expected, but spots something totally unexpected on the wall next to it.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam5]]</center>
<p>
@@.npd;Holy shit... I think I stumbled into some kind of nest.@@ The writhing mass of tentacles, female bodies, and plant material stretches all the way to the far wall, and contains dozens of bodies. Green creatures of varying size but similar shape rest atop the mass, either fucking one of the helpless women or suckling from their breasts. @@.npd;I don't think I can get past them... How am I going to get out? Maybe I should just try to contact Captain Campbell somehow...@@
</p>
<p>
One of the creatures, as of yet unnoticed by Private Jones, is clinging to the wall above the large blast doors. The creature's skin is the same green as the vine tentacles, though it isn't nearly as wet with the unknown slime. It has a long neck with a long snout, and a long tongue to match. It's eyes sit on short eyestalks on either side of it's head. a giant cock dangles between it's legs, massive despite being flaccid. Its thickly-corded muscles tense as it prepares to pounce.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam6]]</center>
<p>
The creature's well-aimed pounce causes its massive bulk to land directly behind Private Jones, its outstretched arms immediately wrapping around her. @@.npd;AAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!@@ she screams in surprise as the creature lifts her from the ground in an unwilling hug. @@.npd;Get off of me you fucking Kermit freak!@@ She squirms and strains to lift her arms, but this only causes the creature to tighten its grip around her torso. @@.npd;Let me go, damnit!!! I said let go!!!@@
</p>
<p>
Some of the creature's saliva drips from its long tongue onto one of Sharen's breasts. She watches as the material visibly weakens, bulging out slightly as it loses its ability to compress the flesh of her breasts. Down below, the monster's hardening cock forces it's way between her legs, coating her thighs and groin in pre in the process. The material covering her left breast suddenly tears, leaving a large hole and exposing most of her delicate nipple in the process.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam7]]</center>
<p>
Jones feels the heat of the tremendous dick between her legs suddenly become more intense and... wet, and realizes that the monster's pre cum has already eaten through her suit to expose her pussy. @@.npd;It's fluids are eating through my armor!@@ Jones takes another look down at the massive member emerging from between her legs. @@.npd;It isn't going to try to stick that inside me, is it?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npd;<i>No way...</i>@@ She steels her resolve and shouts @@.npd;you're not sticking that in me!@@ Suddenly she remembers the comforting sensation of a heavy metal object in her right hand. @@.npd;Why don't you go to hell instead?!@@ Toggling the safety on the 10mm semi-caseless handgun, Jones does her best to aim it at the beast's leg; it's the best she can do with the way her arms are pinned. She squeezes the trigger, shouting @@.npd;I'm <b>NOT</b> your fuck toy, you green freak!@@ releasing the trigger and firing again immediately.
</p>
<p>
At such close range, the two rounds pierce clean through the creature's leg with sprays of blood. It roars deafeningly in anger, and rather than dropping Private Jones as she had hoped, squeezes hard enough to force the air from her lungs and make her ribs creak in protest. It shakes her violently up and down, causing her to lose her grip. The handgun clatters against the floor, sliding toward the middle of the room.
</p>
<p>
The creature adjusts it's grip, grabbing hold of Private Jones' arms, one with each hand, and positioning her above its gargantuan fuck rod. The occasional pulse of pre from the engorged member splashes against Sharen's asshole and runs downward to coat her cunt. Four bulb-tipped tentacles that grow from the beast's back extend outward, seeming to approach her exposed ass with a will of their own.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam8]]</center>
<p>
The creature presses the huge head of its erection against Sharen's back door. @@.npd;That's the wrong hole you idiot!!!@@ she screams, in a panic. The creature ignores her, and simply begins pulling on her arms to force the penetration of her asshole. Luckily, the dribbling and spurting pre of the monster cock eases its way as her body sinks inch by inch onto the throbbing dick. Her sphincter provides little resistance, and soon at least six inches have been buried inside her. @@.npd;Oh my God, how'd it fit that giant thing inside my ass@@ she shouts to nobody in particular, unaware that much of the creature's erection is still waiting to penetrate her.
</p>
<p>
The four tentacles hovering behind her have petals that peel away from the bulb at their tip with a moist sound. A thorn--some kind of organic needle--extends from each of the bulbs, their tips beading with a purplish fluid. As the monstrous member continues to sink deeper inside her, distorting the flesh of her ass in the process, the four tentacles strike. Three pierce the containment suit and the soft flesh of her thighs and ass, while the last takes its time to pierce the erect bud of flesh that is her clit. @@.npd;OWWW! What is that pinching sensation?@@ She looks behind frantically and spots the needle bulb emerging from her ass. @@.npd;It's injecting me?!@@
</p>
<p>
The bulbs pulsate slightly, as they inject their cargo of potent aphrodisiacs, hormones, and other chemicals into Sharen's body. @@.npd;I suddenly feel so warm...@@ She doesn't resist as the creature buries the rest of it's massive member inside her. Her stomach bulges out obscenely, the relentless rod shoving aside other organs to press her colon against the wall of her abdomen. @@.npd;<i>Holy cock this feels <b>SO GOOD!</b></i>@@ The creature uses its long tongue to slather her breasts with saliva as she twitches on its cock, her shallow breaths interspersed with her moans of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
The tentacles retract back into the beast's body as it slowly drags her three quarters of the way off its cock. It suddenly slams the private back down onto its member, the impact of her plump ass against its thighs letting out a loud slap that fills the large chamber. Sharen's breasts have already begun to swell thanks to the influence of the chemical cocktail injected into her. With the containment suit's material weakened by the thing's saliva, the strong impact of that first thrust is enough to cause her large tits to burst free.
</p>
<p>
The creature pulls her part of the way off its cock once more--this time more rapidly--and doesn't hesitate to slam the cock home once more. @@.npd;AAAAHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNN!@@ she lets out a long moan as the second thrust sends her careening over the edge into an orgasm.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam9]]</center>
<p>
The beast begins to fuck her properly, or rather, begins using her like an oversized onahole as it lifts her off and slams her back down on its cock. Private Jones, for her part, simply moans. Her udders continue to grow as they flop back and forth beneath her. It isn't long before they start to sprinkle the floor with fresh milk. 
</p>
<p>
With a particularly savage thrust, the creature hilts itself in her ass and begins to ejaculate. It stays that way as it releases a torrent of cum into her colon, the thick stream of fertile semen almost immediately swelling her belly as it fills her intestines. @@.npd;<i>Oh it's sooo goood, I've never been so full!</i>@@ With the primary exit blocked by a giant cock, the jizz has no option but to flood into Sharen's stomach. Still, the creature continues to spray semen inside her with no sign of letting up or running out of the thick seed.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ResponseTeam10]]</center>
<p>
Private Jones burps--suddenly feels nauseated--experiencing a sensation similar to over-eating as the cum overfills her stomach. She tries to burp once more, to relieve the pressure, but is instead rewarded with a large mouthful of semen. @@.npd;<i>All the way through?!</i>@@ Taking a breath, she is immediately assaulted by the need to vomit. Unbidden, her stomach begins convulsing to expel the thick cum out of her mouth. The fluid splashes against her helmet.
</p>
<p>
After an entire stomach's worth of cum is splashing around the base of her helmet, Jones struggles to catch her breath. Monster seed is already building up in her stomach once more, and she wonders @@.npd;<i>How can it cum so much?!</i>@@ It's only when she starts vomiting up a stomach full of cum for the second time that her predicament truly hits her. @@.npd;<i>My helmet is filling up with cum and I can't take it off!</i>@@ When her uncontrollable vomiting stops--her stomach temporarily emptied of semen--the level of thick fluid in her helmet extends up past her nose. @@.npd;<i>I can't breathe!!!</i>@@
</p>
<p>
Struggling for her life, Jones flings her head back in an attempt to reach the air remaining in her helmet. The creature, taking note of the girl's futile struggle, simply rotates her atop its still-spasming cock. Though this temporarily aids the girl, the monster had no such intention; it's simply seeking new sensation as it's orgasm begins to draw to a close. Jones is able to take a couple choking breaths before the pressure of a full stomach causes another bout of vomiting.
</p>
<p>
The last violent expulsion of cum leaves her helmet almost entirely full. @@.npd;<i>I'm drowning in semen...</i>@@ She peers outward with her one eye that isn't covered by cum, though she doesn't focus on anything. @@.npd;<i>I can't believe I'm going to die like this...</i>@@ Her body spasms as she fights the urge to fill her lungs with cum. The spasms don't last long...

You are given only two options in the final document: either support the decisions or flag the decisions for a review. You were expecting something a little more detailed based on the initial instructions--maybe some way to weasel in your opinion--but it seems all you're left with is a simple 'yes or no'.

You take the elevator all the way down to the first basement level, "A", and start searching for room 37. Unlike the mostly-open cubical farms of the above-ground floors, this basement level seems to consist of a long wide hallway with doors on either side. A helpful sign opposite the elevators points to the left for rooms 1 to 50, so you head that direction while paying attention to the room numbers.
