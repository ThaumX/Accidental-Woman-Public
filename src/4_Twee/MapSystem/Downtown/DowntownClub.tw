@@.head3;T@@here are several drinking establishments in this area of town known as the <i>Club District</i> or just <i>Club Row</i>. Unlike most buildings, these don't have many windows. <<if $time[0] > 3 || $time[0] < 18>>They also seem to be closed from the look of it, though the garish neon sign for the Pole Riders strip club is lit.

    <p><<f y>>ou spend a little time walking down 'club row', peering into alleyways and generally looking about the place. Just looking to kill some time, you didn't have any expectations but you thought you might spot a couple making out--or doing something else interesting. You found a couple, and they were doing generally what you expected, but the couple themselves caught you completely by surprise.</p>
