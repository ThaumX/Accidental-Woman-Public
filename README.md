### Update Frequency

This is the public Git repository for Accidental Woman. It is updated infrequently, and is usually behind the current version of the game (and probably the public version too). This repo exists primarily to make it easier for people to view the code behind Accidental Woman (it can also be viewed by opening the game html in a text editor), and isn't intended for collaboration or creating custom builds. The private git is used for collaboration, and the high level of mod support being built into the game means that supporting special builds is even less desireable.

### Building From The Public Repository

The public repository is incomplete. It does not include all code needed to run the game, most particularly the customized Twine story format.
