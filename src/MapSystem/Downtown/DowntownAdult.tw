@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing on a walking street winding through a block of redbrick buildings. Unlike the strait and open sidewalks of the rest of downtown, the adult district is mostly narrow curving alleys. It has a mysterious or even romantic atmosphere, disrupted by the occasional sign reminding citizens that prostitution is illegal or any number of other public service messages.
