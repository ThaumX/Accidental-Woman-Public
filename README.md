### Update Frequency

This is the public Git repository for Accidental Woman. It is updated infrequently, and is usually behind the current version of the game (and probably the public version too). This repo exists primarily to make it easier for people to view the code behind Accidental Woman. It can also be viewed by opening the game html in a text editor, but that format is rather inconvenient, to say the least! This repo **is not** intended for collaboration or for players to create the latest build. The private git is used for collaboration, and we don't want transitional builds out in the public because it makes bug tracking and correction more difficult (plus we routinely "break" the game while working on systems).

### Building From The Public Repository

Don't even try, honestly. In order to build you would need the AW variant of SugarCube, several other tools, and AW's Eropiler. I don't even want to imagine trying to support people making their own builds. Writing detailed instructions would take a lot of time, and I'm afraid that for each person that was able to build from scratch, there would be 10 or more than would need help on some stage of the process or another.
