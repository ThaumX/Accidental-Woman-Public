<p>@@.head3;T@@he visitor center's interior is nicely appointed, but the large space feels empty without a lot of people in it. There is a sort of historical exhibit occupying a good portion of the space, with items and signs talking about the history of Muschi Valley, along with the changes that've happened since the Institute moved in. There is also a small area of Muschi Valley merchandise, with some obligatory racks of tourism brochures.</p>

  <<button "History Exhibit">><<addTime 15>><<dialog "Visitor Center Exhibit">><p><<f y>>ou take your time casually looking at the exhibit on the history of Muschi Valley. Being so hard to access, you're a little surprised that Native American civilization seemed to be so advanced in the area. The signs say that the locals were somehow connected to the Mississippian civilization, despite the great distance. Judging by the pottery artifacts on display, it seems like they were very focused on fertility here. The information states that Muschi Valley was a highly religious site, with many priests living here. There are even some theories about long pilgrimages to reach the valley, tied in to other archeological sites stretching out to the west. It seems like the certain people may have traveled up the Ohio river and then made the difficult journey to this location, but the exhibit doesn't explain the reason for it at all.</p><center>[img[IMG-NativePottery1]]<br>[img[IMG-NativePottery2]]</center><</dialog>><</button>>
