<<set ↂ.flag.job.HD.training = true>>
<p class="yellow">
Sadly, I didn't have time to write this whole event with this release, as adding in the Dairy Hand job was something of a last-minute addition for this release. I normally would just exclude it, but it's scheduled to happen before the hecow training, so we need the variables set properly. In any case, this event basically covers hucows: what they are, how they work, common terminology, and some basics about their lifestyle at the Farm Coop. It should be interesting for those into hucows, but it isn't necessary as long as you know the basics of what a hucow is (as most people probably do). The hecow event ''IS'' written, and it's somewhat more original than basic hucows, so you can look forward to that popping up in the next few days of work at the dairy. :D

<<set ↂ.flag.job.HD.hecow = true>>
<<comment "I'm pretty proud of coining the term 'hecow' for male hucows. Unlike the macho dominant bulls that breed the hucows and produce semen for sale, hecows are very heavily feminized males that tend to be submissive, and milked of both semen and milk. I'm sure the concept isn't entirely original, I've seen various concepts/art of submissive males being milked for semen, and of course sissification/feminization that goes so far as to make giant 'udders', but slapping this all together into a realistic concept might be pretty original. Who knows though, the internet is huge, so it may be like some whole thing I had never heard of in some corner of literotica or something.">>
<p>
Today you're assigned to take a class on hecows as part of your training. Since the Farm Coop has gotten a few hecows, the whole Dairy division has had to do some training on them. For your part, you didn't even know that there was such a thing as a hecow until you started working here. The concept seems a little strange to you, <<has dom>>but the idea of dominating these little subby cuties definitely has some appeal.<<or>>but it makes a certain kind of sense when you think about it. You may not prefer to be the dominant one, but you think it might be fun to try out with one of these cuties.<</has>>
</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
The hecow, or male hucow, is a feminized infertile male. They have large udders that produce milk, and significantly enlarged prostate glands that make semen harvesting far more productive. Their milk production rarely matches that of a true hucow due to a lack of pregnancy and smaller udders on average. Their semen production, while infertile, is much higher than that of a traditional bull. Hecows require a set of hormonal implants in order to maintain their endocrine system, however these implants are inexpensive and have been largely standardized.
</p>
<p>
Hecows tend to be highly feminized, and hecows that started their transition by their mid twenties typically can't be distinguished from females without examining their genitalia. Hecows that transitioned after their mid twenties can still be hard to distinguish without close examination due to the transformative effects. All hucows have a wide pelvic structure to support their enlarged prostate glands. There isn't a fixed hecow penile size. By default, hecows have small testicles and a very small penis, however some hecows can be well endowed with transformatives to allow them to serve a secondary role as comfort tools for hucows. 
</p>
<p>
Though biologically male, the high amount of feminization combined with high submissiveness mean that female pronouns are typically used to refer to them. In general, nearly all hecows are satisfied with this, but do take note if a particular hecow prefers other pronouns.
</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>
During the period when hucows and bulls were becoming mainstream after the ravaging of furious cow, a certain group of mistresses who typically the domme sissy or feminized submissive males got the idea to use hucow transformative products to generate a male hucow. Through experimentation and an availability of partners willing to--or able to be gently coerced into--taking feminization and hucow treatments, they eventually perfected the precursor to the modern hecow. It is believed that their effort was largely separate from any monetary consideration, and was primarily driven by dominant/sadistic/sexual motivations.
</p>
<p>
Information about these sissy cows spread in the BDSM community, and was eventually latched onto by certain dominant individuals looking to produce male hucows for profit. There was a strong demand for a semen market, as shown by initial sales of excess hubull semen. This demand for 'real' semen remains to this day, though there is now an established market for both real and vat semen. These dominant women likely planned to cash in on the potential cash advantage of a single human producing large quantities of semen, with milk production seen as an additional cash advantage. It was important for these proto hecows to be submissive and easy to manage in an industrial setting, as well as be willing to have their semen primarily harvested rather than spent in intercourse with hucows.
</p>
<p>
The initial hecow creation process used by this group, was perfected by this group using online networking and results from their use in real dairies. Several years ago, the template for the modern hecow was completed and was then standardized upon its adoption by the American Dairy Association. Since then there have been a few process and drug improvements to increase productiveness and improve the reliability and speed of the process.
</p>
<h3>Exploitation</h3>
<p>
Despite the adoption of the hecow as an official dairy producer by the ADA, the production of new hecows was still very limited. While many dairies were willing to take on a hecow due to their profitability, few were willing to deal with recruiting and transitioning hecows themselves. Part of this is due to the more significant amount of transformatives and gene modifications required, as well as the need for minor surgical implants. Because society was still adapting socially to hucows, and because dairies still faced resistance from activist groups claiming that dairies exploit hucows or even trick normal women into becoming hucows, they were unwilling to start producing their own hecows. There was an obvious concern that outside viewers would never accept that a male would willingly go through the hecow transformation process.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this led to a market opening where dairies were very interested in hiring the profitable hecows, but were unwilling to produce them themselves. It is unknown whether dairies began offering recruiting and hiring bonuses first, or if this was a retroactive way of legitimizing illegal hecow producers. The most notorious group of hecow producers was known as the Tsar Ranchers, a group of predominantly Russian and Eastern European immigrant women with ties to the Russian Mafia in the Unified States.
</p>
<p>
The Tsar Ranchers would prey on men that were into the submissive side of BDSM or were simply into femdom. Unfortunately, the internet and local BDSM clubs gave them plentiful access to such men. Preying on these males, the Tsar Ranchers would eventually lure them to spend time at one of many "cattle ranches" that they operated out of. While the initial interactions were largely consensual, and may even involve an escalating level of sissy play, this was all part of a well-rehearsed process of getting future cows to visit the cattle ranch. Once there, a mistress would start them on the road to permanent feminization and hucow mods, with the ultimate goal of selling them to a nearby dairy for good profit.
</p>
<p>
Police raids on these cattle ranches found consent to be extremely dubious in the best of cases. In most, males were simply locked in cages and subjected to harsh behavioral programming techniques while undergoing their transition. These locations were rarely very concerned about the health of their product, often rushing males through the transformation process far faster than recommended by the ADA. Once the existence of the illegal industry spread, the ADA was quick to ban the use of recruitment or hiring bonuses by its members. Many states also enacted similar laws, though it still remains an issue in some "pink" states that haven't enacted any hecow or male protection laws.
</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Hecows have a vastly enlarged prostate gland, which can eventually cause problems with urination or even defecation if not properly managed. Fortunately minor corrective surgery and the use of specially designed anal plugs have corrected these issues in the modern dairy. A unique property of the Tsar Cow is their production of semen, specifically the lack of viable sperm cells. The hormonal changes render Tsar Cows infertile, however their emissions are almost identical to that of a normal male; the only difference is that they lack sperm cells.
</p>
<p>
Hecow semen can be harvested much easier than bulls, who require more intense stimulation to ejaculate. While hecows can ejaculate, minor stimulation or arousal will cause them dribble semen at a fairly constant rate. It is suspected that this is similar to the female lubrication response, and it allows hecows semen to be harvested without providing ejaculatory stimulation. Like hucows, hecows commonly receive orgasms during milking, this does cause an ejaculatory response. It has proven to be very convenient to milk a hecows udders and prostate at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Priapism is nearly universal in hecows, and is caused by their enlarged prostates. The standard template hecow penis is only 1 to 2 inches long when erect, so the long-term priapism doesn't have any significant health consequences. This short length is also convenient for harvesting, because standard milk collection cups and milking equipment can be used to harvest the semen with a relatively simple addition of a nitrogen line. Like hucows, hecows also are afflicted with a truly ludicrous libido, however, their natural submissiveness means that they largely satisfy themselves with being milked. Due to their large and sensitive prostate glands, hecows almost universally love anal penetration. Regular weekly prostate massage is recommended for hecows for health purposes.
</p>
<p>
While standard hecows are generally pretty useless for penetrating others, those that have had a strong course of penile enhancement transformatives can have a normal-sized or even large penis. Because the hecows will easily submit to hucow demands, when modified this way they can be used as comfort partners for the dairy's hucows. Additionally, their standard infertility make them ideal comfort partners for resident hucows on a strict breeding schedule. Though this use can be valuable in some circumstances, it doesn't add to the production capability of the hecow herself.
</p>
<p>
The training session in the classroom is mostly dull, though the information is generally interesting at least. You find the hands on portion of the class to be a lot more interesting.

:: JobEvent-Hucow-BraTrap [nobr]

<<set ↂ.flag.job.HD.braTrap = true>>
<center>[img[IMG-Hucow-BraTrap2]]</center>
<p>
One of the newer hucow girls ends up crying as she struggles to put on a bra after her milking is over. You immediately walk over and comfort her until she has calmed down somewhat. She tearfully explains to you that she's really looking forward to a date, and wanted to wear something special. Unfortunately, the size of her still-developing udders was a little too much to manage and she wasn't able to put it on. She tried putting her breasts in the cups and then fastening the clasp behind her back, but her arms simply lacked the strength in that position. Likewise, fastening it around her belly and trying to pull it up also failed. She finally tried to fasten the band over her breasts and then rotate it, but the friction was too great and she ended up getting her sensitive nipple trapped by a metal ring.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-Hucow-BraTrap1]]</center>
<p>
You first help extract her from her current predicament, careful to avoid hurting her nipple as you unfasten the bra. You check how well the 36-N bra fits, and discover that it'll fit, but it'll start getting pretty uncomfortable as her udders fill. You tell her to be careful about that, and give her a confidence-boosting talk about her breasts. @@.pc;You've got great breasts dear, and they're only going to get better. You should be proud of them like any hucow has a right to be, you're helping to feed the world! You don't have to wear any prison-like bras or restrictive tops to look good, your udders look magnificent just the way they are! If you really want to be fashionable out in town or on a date, you should look into getting a pretty nipple bikini. Most of the girls call them teat-kinis, but I've heard nipple-kini too. I'm sure one of the older girls could help you find one that looks great. They are way more comfortable, and they handle leaky teats better than the silly clothes for normal girls could.@@
</p>
<p>
The hucow girl admits that she really IS proud of her udders, and normally doesn't bother with a top at all. She also admits that she's still too nervous to go topless on tonight's date. She gives you a soft hug and says she'll be sure to look into teat-kinis for next time. With a gentle pat on her shapely behind, you send her off to finish getting ready for her date.

<p>
Near the end of the day, <<= _n>>, one of the newer hucow girls asked for your help before beginning her milking. It seems she's going to be taking a trip home to see her parents, and wants your help with clothes. You take her to a counseling room where you can help her without her having to worry about being embarrassed.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-JobEvent-Hucow-Brafit1]]</center>
<p>
Once she's with you in the room, she immediately jumps into her problem. @@.npc;I really need your help <<name>>! Next week is gonna be my first trip home to see my parents since I decided to become a hucow. Here on the farm and in Appletree, I do the usual.@@ She hefts her bare breasts to emphasize what she means. @@.npc;But I'm scared that'd be too much for my parents, even if I always wore a teat-kini. Anyway, last weekend I went shopping and managed to find a couple bras that would fit my udders. Without one I'm afraid I'd leak right through whatever blouse or shirt I wore.@@
</p>
<p>
You nod your head knowingly. @@.pc;That's right dear, the contact with clothes will usually make you leak a lot more than usual. It's pretty hard to hide the wet spots, too.@@ She seems to have be aware of this, so you ask what the problem is. @@.npc;So you went and got some bras--and hopefully some nipple pads to soak up the milk--what's giving you a problem?@@
</p>
<p>
She gestures to her udders that are still small for a hucow, but never-the-less impressive compared to most women. @@.npc;It's my girls. I made sure they fit on the weekend, I even made sure the bras were a little on the big side because I know I'm still slowly growing. I purposely waited until it's nearly time for a new growth treatment so I wouldn't be changing much on my trip home. But still, it ended up like this...@@ She sighs. @@.npc;Let me show you.@@ She pulls a new black bra from her bag and starts putting it on.
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Sure, show me what's happening.@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-JobEvent-Hucow-Brafit2]]</center>
<p>
Once she manages to squeeze into the bra, she turns to show you. It's way too small, her tit flesh is bulging from the top and sides of the cups. @@.npc;See? This just fit on Sunday!@@ She unhooks the bra, which pops away from her tits once the tension is released. She shrugs it off, letting it fall to the floor. @@.npc;I could understand if it was just that one. Maybe the fabric was dodgy and a wash n' air dry made it shrink or something. But it's all three of them! Just look at this one, it was my favorite.@@
</p>
<p>
You're pretty sure you know what the problem is, but you're not in a rush so you figure it's better to let her finish explaining things her way. She slips on a very pretty lace and sheer mesh bra.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-JobEvent-Hucow-Brafit3]]</center>
<p>
Like last time, she turns to show it off at different angles. Again, it's way too small for her udders. @@.npc;This one is the same, it doesn't fit at all!@@
</p>
<p>
You acknowledge her problem with a nod. @@.pc;Don't worry, <<= _n>>, I understand. I also know what's causing your problem, it's actually a combination of two things.@@ You give her a reassuring smile. @@.pc;The first is that you're probably pretty full of milk right now. You probably haven't really noticed thanks to being topless all the time, but your breast size should be varying a good deal based on how much cream is stored in them.@@
</p>
<p>
<<= _n>> interrupts. @@.npc;But I looked online before I went shopping! It said breast size doesn't change that much from milking, and that I should find a bra after being milked!@@
</p>
<p>
You look at her apologetically. @@.pc;I'm sorry, but most of the information online isn't intended for hucows, and often isn't very accurate in the first place. Breast size increases as milk as stored, and decreases with milking. This isn't a direct relationship, 3ml of breast milk only corresponds to about 1cc of breast size. A normal breastfeeding woman may only have their breasts each change by 30cc, which when compared to the whole breast is a pretty small change overall.@@ You shrug and point at <<= _n>>'s udders. @@.pc;You're producing a lot more milk than that, in a lot more gland tissue. But even you probably mostly just notice the change in weight and firmness because you aren't usually wearing something that makes the size change obvious. Those size changes are another reason hucows don't wear bras, besides bras being unhealthy and making you sag, that is.@@
</p>
<p>
The hucow nods at your explanation. @@.npc;That makes sense... I'm making over two liters with each udder at a milking, I know I've still got a ways to go to get my milk production high enough...@@ She starts doing math on her fingers. @@.npc;wow, that's nearly 800cc per tit! It's sooo crazy that I never really noticed it before.@@ She hefts her large tits through the bra and gives them a proud smile. @@.npc;Still, why would those websites tell you to pick a bra with empty tits? that just seems mean!@@
</p>
<p>
You share her proud smile. @@.pc;You're doing real good, <<= _n>>. You're making steady progress toward the minimum production goal. I won't harp on it, but going ahead and having your first pregnancy would make a big difference for you. Besides, all the hucows say they love being pregnant.@@ You shrug apologetically after making the suggestion, <<= _n>> has been resistant to being bred since she arrived. @@.pc;Anyways, it's your choice dear. The websites tell normal gals to pick a bra on empty tanks because it's useful to help remind them not to go too long without milking. A lot of women pump, after all. One of the other dairy hands told me that it's a holdover from second-wave feminism that they never changed. Back then most women were using formula to feed their babies, and wearing tight bras was used to make lactation stop faster.@@
</p>
<p>
<<= _n>> shakes her head and chuckles. @@.npc;So those crazies were screwing things up way back then, huh?@@ She looks thoughtful for a moment, before suddenly speaking up. @@.npc;Miss <<name>>, you said there were two reasons for this bad fit.@@ She starts taking off the pretty see-through bra, looking a lot happier now that she knows what's going on.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-JobEvent-Hucow-Brafit4]]</center>
<p>
You had totally forgotten about the other reason, but you figure you might as well tell her because it's useful information. @@.pc;The second reason is that when your breasts first grow from a treatment, it's new tissue that's growing. That includes new glands and ducts that produce milk, and possibly some enlargement of existing glands. That growth slows down pretty quick, and then slowly tapers off. But the thing is, the new gland tissue isn't producing milk yet, those baby glands aren't ready yet. After a while though, those glands will slowly swell and then start producing milk. The ducts also become more firmly established as well. That causes udder size to slowly start increasing in the second week, and then even more in the third week. It'll taper off during the 4th week, and then it's time for the next treatment. Based on what you said, that means this is the third week, so it's normal to expect more growth than you did last week.@@
</p>
<p>
She smiles at you. @@.npc;Hey, that explains why it always takes a little time for my milk production to go up!@@ She laughs joyously. @@.npc;I was always curious about that, cause everyone just pays attention to the big growth those first few days.@@ She starts folding the bras to put them back in her bag. @@.npc;I guess I'll have to go buy some more bras this weekend, this time I'll wait till I'm ready for a milking before I try them on. Hopefully they have something pretty in that size, it was really hard already getting these...@@
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-JobEvent-Hucow-Brafit5]]</center>
<p>
You realize that she's just going to be wasting more money and time on some bras she'll only be able to wear for a week. @@.pc;If I were you, I wouldn't waste my money on new bras. Besides, I'm sure your parents will understand you just wearing a teat-kini, you're a hucow after all. Besides, you should be proud of your udders, they're shaping up magnificently, not to mention helping to feed the world!@@
</p>
<p>
<<= _n>> looks at you sheepishly. @@.npc;You see, the problem is, I haven't told my parents that I became a hucow yet... They weren't entirely happy that I decided not to go to college and start working instead. I just told them that I moved to Appletree for a job.@@

You nod sympathetically. @@.pc;I see now... I'm sorry I've kept tempting you with it while you were working hard to resist.@@ You pat her arm a couple times apologetically. @@.pc;Anyhow, the bulls aren't doing it because they don't like you, or because they're just assholes. They have their own rules to follow, rules it seems Diesel bent to let you blow him, I might add. Their stuff gets milked too, you see. So aside from that they're only supposed to use it on gals looking to get bred, and a limited amount of comforting of some of the pregnant girls. They're just being considerate because they know you don't want to get pregnant, and they also know that it's pretty unlikely a condom is going to be strong enough to survive one of them cumming in it.@@

Your breast size will keep changing, so the pads are going to fall out of place pretty much right away. All the stimulation of rubbing around inside a loose bra will have you leaking like a faucet, so in the end, it won't do you much good. Instead, get some tape--medical tape or dress tape will work--and use it to tape the milk pads over your nipples. That'll reduce stimulation from your shirt because the pads will stay in place on your nipples, and they'll also soak up any leaking milk. Then you can wear whatever shirts you were planning, and you'll probably be a lot more comfortable.@@

:: JobContent-Hucow-LeakTube [nobr]

<p>
Today you spotted milk starting to enter one of the secondary pressure lines that power the teat squeezing action of a standard collection cup. The main milk suction line connects to an airtight flexible sleeve that sits inside the cup and surrounds the teat. The area between the cup and the sleeve receives either pressurized air to cause the sleeve to squeeze down on the nipple, or has all the air vacuummed out to make a sucking motion that forces the teat to expand. Separating the stimulation from milk collection allows steady suction to be applied via the milk line, which also results in much faster collection. Seeing milk in the secondary pressure line means that the sleeve inside the attached cup is probably damaged and allowing some milk to leak into the cup itself. It's not all that uncommon, considering the stress the sleeve is exposed to in use, and the high temperature steam used to clean the assembled cups between milkings.
</p>
<p>
You grab a cup from the rack next to the milking bench of the hucow with the defective sleeve and quickly check to make sure it's clean. You then turn the correct valves to the on position, and the teat cup comes to life with the hiss of suction from the milk line. Patting the arm of the hucow so she won't be startled, you pop the damaged cup off her teat. Almost immediately you suck the teat into your mouth to give it a little attention, which is something of a custom in the dairy barn to make up for small interruptions. After swallowing a mouthful, you gently slide the new cup onto the hucow's teat to resume the milking. You take out the damaged liner from the teat cup, just so it won't be used again on accident. You'll have to replace it and sterilize the pressure line after these girls are finished getting milked. For now, you go back to supervising the milking and helping the hucows who need it, satisfied that you prevented any contamination or equipment damage with your catch.
</p>

<p>
Cupcake has problems getting milked again today. She has truly humongous nipples, easily the largest of all the hucows in the dairy. They're so big you can easily stick a couple fingers inside, and the rumor is that she's even managed to fit a dick into one on occasion. In any case, she needs to use larger diameter collection cups so they can provide the right stimulation; standard size cups just can't stimulate her enough. The problem is that she forgot to use the larger cups when she hooked herself up, something you're quickly able to fix.
</p>
<p>
Cupcake--formerly known as Zoe Kagawa--has a lot of Asian ancestry, and developed something of a complex over her small breasts when she was younger. She spent most of high school as a B cup, and only managed to hit C cup by the end of her second year in college. With no hope of any further growth, and having a massive complex about her breast size, Cupcake decided to start experimenting with hucow modifications. It was the most effective and affordable option for her, and led her quickly down the road to becoming a full-time hucow.
</p>
<p>
Despite the prodigious growth of her udders, it was never enough to satisfy her breast size complex. Being around hucows caused her to start comparing herself to them rather than the much more reasonable E cup average of people her age. In a failed attempt to get just one more dose of Bovinex before the dairy doctor would allow it, she ordered via the black market and ended up getting the much cheaper Teat Enhancer labeled as Bovinex. While it's almost been long enough for another real dose of Bovinex, she'll have to decide if it's worth the potential risk of growing even bigger teats. Because of her continuing complex and desire to catch up to the other hucows, she'll most likely take that risk.
</p>


:: JobContent-Hucow-Niplux [nobr]

<p>
One of the new hucow girls prances over to show off her Nip-Lux nipple coating. The young girl's still growing; while she has good nipple girth and really nice puffiness to her areolas, her nipples are quite short. In fact, they look to be about flat when not erect. That can make milking uncomfortable as more areola is pulled into the narrow portion of the collection cup. This means that the suction motion to stimulate the nipple and rhythmically squeeze the areola ends up causing some extra friction. The friction can result in chaffing, especially with several milkings happening each day.
</p>
<p>
The dairy recommends that the cows with short nipples use some cream or salve to prevent injury and keep the process pleasurable for the hucows to avoid any negative associations with milking. In the milking area, there's a policy for the affected girls to show their teats before getting milked, so we can apply some lubricant if the hucow forgot.
</p>
<p>
There's a new nipple coating called Nip-Lux on the market, and you have to admit that it looks really attractive when applied, making the nipples gleam as if they've been coated with fresh oil. Despite the fresh wet look, it's actually some kind of dried-on coating that lasts pretty much all day, even with the regular milkings. You can even suck on a Nip-Lux nipple directly, and it's pretty much tasteless. You haven't tried it, but the girls that have say it sensitizes their nipples so it feels even better during milkings or playtime. That's pretty impressive, because hucow nipples are notoriously sensitive; multiple nipple orgasms during milking is the norm. @@.mono;I wonder what it'd be like to have nipple orgasms happen even easier than clit orgasms?@@
</p>

Some non-hucow women have even turned it into something of a fashion statement, wearing Nip-Lux and going topless. And while going topless is pretty normal for hucows--unless they're dressing fancy with nipple cover bikini tops--even the hucows with well-developed teats want it for its beauty and sensitizing effects. The huge demand has led to a pretty serious market shortage for now... so the girls who are able to get some usually flaunt it. Thankfully the more developed hucows are pretty nurturing to the new ones, so they usually let the girls who need it buy the available supply.
