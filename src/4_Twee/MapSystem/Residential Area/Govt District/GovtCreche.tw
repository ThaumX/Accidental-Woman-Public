:: Baby-PlayTime [nobr]

You know that there is an area with several toys for children of that age, deciding that you want to have some quality time with your child you start talking. @@.pc;Shall we leave the cradle? Mommy wants to spend time with you.@@<br><br>

You smile at your baby, before gently picking him up and going to the play area for children under 2 years old. When you arrive you can see a circular area surrounded with a glass barrier of a few centimeters, preventing the children from leaving there and padded with a soft and clean plush carpet. Several toys are scattered on the playground and two nurses watch from afar while the children play.<br><br>

Then you place your child on the soft floor, sitting next to him and encouraging him to start exploring the new environment and playing with objects. @@.pc;Come on, <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>! You have a whole new world to discover... Let mommy help you.@@<br><br>

You bite your lips in a motherly animation before you start to encourage your baby to handle toys, a huge myriad of educational objects, or for pure fun. You can't help but try to stimulate some words from your baby and spend several minutes admiring them while your child crawls on the floor, interested in selecting some specific toys while ignoring others and starting to show interest. @@.pc;This... You can put these cubes together and make words with it.@@<br><br>

You put together a few cubes forming a few words, always trying to stimulate your child's first words. You speak slowly each of the words you have formed, looking directly into your baby's eyes. @@.pc;Love... Life... Kindness...@@<br><br>

After a few minutes and amid a few laughs you can hear your baby babbling a word, although not quite yet. @@.pc;Hehe, you're getting there! You'll soon be able to master this, baby.@@<br><br>

You forget about the passing of time while still playing with your baby, allowing yourself to be carried away by those pleasurable moments always feeling great satisfaction when donating your time to your child.<br><br>

Looking around you don't see many mothers, you start to remember Victoria's words when she mentions that modern parents no longer want to dedicate themselves to their children, preferring to leave them in a daycare or school, and then forget about their existence. For a few moments, your mind wanders through those thoughts, making you feel a great emptiness when thinking about these situations, lack of love, and hopelessness take your heart for a brief moment breaking your smile and starting to bring down your mood until until you look at your baby again.

You come out of the depths of your thoughts and turn to your baby, who is looking directly at you. I realize that he is slowly beginning to master the power of language, and one of his first words was you. This sheds light on the emptiness you felt, causing maternal love to come back into you, which expresses this with an affectionate smile, stroking your baby's short hair.<br><br>

Again, you turn totally towards your baby, without remembering the passage of time. Several minutes later you realize that <<name>> is already looking exhausted and you need to return your baby to the crib. You carry him on your lap back to his sleeping place, where a nurse is changing the sheet. @@.npd;Mrs. <<surname>>! I just cleaned your baby's crib, I hope the time on the playground was pleasant.@@<br><br>

@@.pc;Yeah, that was it.@@ You don't mention much more, but your expression reflects your state of mind and your love for your baby. You put him in the clean cradle, gently so you don't wake him up. The nurse seems to smile a little when she sees your care for your baby.<br><br>

@@.npd;It is not very common to see mothers regularly present here...@@ A brief moment of silence passes before you remember your routine and duties, looking at your phone and remembering that you spent about 2 hours.<br><br>

@@.pc;I need to go now, take care of him, please...@@ The nurse responds with a positive nod before you leave.<br><br><br>

:: BabyOlder-ChangingDiapers [nobr]

After a few moments, you feel a smelly airwave reaching you, considering the distance of the other children, only <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> may be giving off that smell. You realize that you have to do something about it, you probably have a case of dirty diapers in your hands. @@.pc;Ugh... I think you need some help with that.@@<br><br>

You make an expression that displays a mixture of tension and tenderness, although you love your child and dedicate yourself to them, those moments are always unpleasant. You take <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> on your lap and take it out of the playground area. Upon leaving a nurse asks if you would like help with something. @@.npc;Mrs. <<surname>>, if you want I can change the <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> diaper.@@<br><br>

She mentions it, also seeming to smell it. @@.pc;N-No, I take care of that, I want to do something for my child... Besides just having moments of play. << = setup.selectedChild.name >> it's my responsibility...@@<br><br>

The nurse seems a little surprised by your statement, but she just nods, indicating the birthplace of <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>. When you arrive at the crib again you have a pair of clean diapers waiting on the bedside table next to you, the nurses keep everything in good condition. @@.pc;Great, that's a big help... Now... The diaper...@@<br><br>

You mention it by laying <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> on the table and taking a few seconds to gather the courage to do that. Biting your lips, you unfasten the sides of the diaper, opening it, and then you are hit again by a smelly wave, holding your breath you can see your child's poop, however, at that age the poop is already solid. @@.pc;Y-Yeah, I imagined something like this, let's clean you up.@@<br><br>

You roll up the dirty diaper and throw it in the trash, then you take a new diaper and leave it open while you look for something to clean the <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> butt. You use a small white towel, deciding that this will do, you pass it on your child's ass to remove any remnants of poop and prevent diaper rash. @@.pc;Uh... I think this is enough, clean again!@@<br><br>

You celebrate your victory, immediately noticing a baby ointment to your left. You start to feel like a mother of Netflix series, traditional women, and dedicated to their children. Most women today see this as something from another reality, many think it would mean the end of life for them, but you don't feel that way. The experience of motherhood, responsibility, and the desire to fulfill your role in your child's life fills you with maternal love, giving greater meaning to your life and your efforts. You know you could just abandon your child here and never see you again, but you don't want to do that, and thinking about doing such a thing makes you feel bad.<br><br>

You turn your baby's ass up high, and fill your hand with smooth ointment, hoping it will be enough and pour it out with gentle movements. The skin <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> is soft, as smooth as the ointment you hold. You feel that the responsibility of being a mother is difficult, but it is rewarding. After a few moments you spread it over the butt of <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, and then you're free to put on the new diaper. It is a little awkward in the beginning, but soon you can position your baby correctly, fitting it in the diaper. @@.pc;Victory, clean again! It took a few minutes.@@<br><br>

You smile for yourself, before returning your baby to the playground area. You spend a lot of time with <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> until it is time for you to get back to your tasks.<br><br><br>

:: BabyOlder-BabyPlayVideo [nobr]

You watch your child play happily with the various toys scattered on the floor when you have an idea. Dedicated mothers in general enjoy proudly making remembrance videos, even posting it on social media for everyone to see their source of pride. Liking the idea, you pull your cell phone out of your pocket and immediately adjust the camera to your profile, starting to record your baby. @@.pc;Hey <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, what are you doing? Hehe@@<br><br>

<<= setup.selectedChild.name>> looks at you, but without responding in words, just taking a block of letters and offering it to you before turning to a different toy. You let out a smile with a little laugh as you continue to record your baby. @@.pc;This is my baby <<= setup.selectedChild.sexDesc>>, <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>. He's already over a year...@@<br><br>

You continue to share some trivial information about your baby while allowing him to continue playing but always following him closely. One of the next toys is a box with a puzzle, you are sure it should not be here for children so young, but you give it a chance thinking about having some good memories. @@.pc;<<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, do you know what this is? Say yes or no to mommy.@@<br><br>

You open the box by placing this in front of your baby, he tries to stammer an answer, but you don't quite understand the meaning. @@.npc;Do!@@<br><br>

@@.pc;Do you know? Do you know that you need to fit each piece in the correct place?@@<br><br>

@@npc;Mommy? hehe@@ He laughs at you, even though he knows that <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> still doesn't understand your words, he throws some pieces of the puzzle in the air, you expected such a reaction though.<br><br>

@@.pc;Haha, I think it's too early to try this...@@ You follow the recording for a few minutes while your son spends his energy with you and the playground toys, you finish the video with 20 minutes of recording, with a message for the other mothers of Appletree.<br><br>

@@.pc;For any mother who is listening to me, I know that many simply abandon their children at the government daycare... My advice is, don't do this. Motherhood is difficult and requires responsibility, but I can't imagine how empty life would be without my son's love. Rethink what you are doing.@@ After the last and serious message, some very simple, yet deeply maternal and pleasant moments that are now recorded on your social network for all to see.<br><br>

You continue for a long time having fun with your baby until he is tired and his energy is spent, then you go back to your tasks knowing that he is safe and well taken care of.<br><br><br>

:: Child-BasicClass [nobr]

You sit next to your child, he is distracted by some friends when you arrive and kneel in front of him. @@.pc;Hi darling. How are you?@@<br><br>

@@.npd;Mommy!@@ You receive a hug and cannot contain a smile.<br><br>

@@.pc;Let's pay attention in class now, okay? Just for a while.@@ <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> has not yet fully mastered the gift of speech, but your child can already speak some things and has excellent motor coordination. You ask that name sit beside you, in front of the young teacher who continues the effort to pass on basic teachings about the alphabet and the pronunciation of words.<br><br>

In the beginning, your child pays attention, but at some point, another child calls the attention of <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, you decide to rebuke that. @@.pc;<<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, dear... Please, now you need to pay attention in class.@@<br><br>

You draw your child's attention back to class, knowing that children of that age easily lose focus, you just encourage him to do the right thing. @@.npd;Hehe... Sorry, mommy.@@<br><br>

You continue to ensure that your child's attention is focused on the class for the next few minutes, always also offering support, especially in terms of improving speaking skills. <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> is still unable to form large sentences, but learning and helping with this makes you feel very satisfied. @@.pc;Listen to mommy now, do you see that sentence? Repeat slowly...@@<br><br>

<<= either(
  "You constantly encourage <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> to do its best, even though your child still doesn't understand exactly what's going on. Watching <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> practice your speaking skills fills you with maternal pride, you bite your lower lip feeling your heart fill with that feeling and caress his <<= setup.selectedChild.hairCurlDesc>>, <<= setup.selectedChild.hairColor>> hair.",
  "Despite your best efforts, it is difficult to maintain the focus of name in class, you dedicate yourself to the maximum though. Your child is the cutest thing you've ever seen, at least you feel that way every time you see him, you hug him gently in the middle of the class, giving a manifestation of love that ends up filling everyone's eyes."
)>><br><br>

The class lasts more than an hour, but the moments with your children are always very pleasant and you do not see the time passing, just remembering your routine when you again receive a message on your cell phone, which vibrates in your pocket. @@.npc;I see that duty also calls you, thanks for helping with that, these little devils have more energy than 3 adult people at that age.@@<br><br>

The young teacher speaks, realizing that you will need to get back to your tasks. @@.pc;Now mommy needs to go, but I'll be back, okay? Behave yourself, dear.@@<br><br>

<<= setup.selectedChild.name>> seems to be very sad when you mention it, you feel the same, but you kiss your child's forehead and get out of it, knowing that <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> is protected.<br><br><br>

You approach <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> and ask your child to have fun with you. <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> welcomes you cheerfully, already managing to speak a few words, but not yet very elaborate phrases.<br><br>

@@.npd;Mommy! Want play?@@ You let out a little laugh, but take your child's hand and take it to the center of the yard where most of the children's toys are, already designed to stimulate the motor coordination of young children.<br><br>

@@.pc;I came to spend some time with you, come on... What do you want to do? You say, then <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> points to the balance, without saying any more than a mischievous smile, typical of children of that age. Full of life, energy, and innocence. You take your child on your lap and take him to an empty spot on the swing, feeling that <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> has grown considerably, no longer being the baby you carried easily in your arms, and that he will grow much more. You feel that you need to enjoy each moment with <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, each day is precious.<br><br>

@@.pc;Let's do this!@@ You put him on the floor in front of the swing, where he quickly sits down, and looking at you with a mischievous smile looks at you in anticipation that you start to pack this.

<<= either(
  "After several moments you have a broken focus when you see on the side a girl of about 3 years old on the swing, trying to propel herself.

You are brought back from your thoughts by the voice of <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> though.", 
  "You see two mothers focused on their children, as young as you are, and as laid back as you can judge. This is an image that gives your heart a little hope, even though you know that many of these children are forgotten here by their parents, almost never receiving attention from their mothers.",
  "You can forget about your problems during that moment, you are dedicating all your love and attention to your child, being filled with a strong maternal affection and the satisfaction of having the chance to give that love to your child."

@@.pc;<<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, we've been playing around for a long time, but I need to go now ...

:: Child-ChildPlayVideo [nobr]

You approach << = setup.selectedChild.name >> and think of something fun, a video as a souvenir during a game is always a useful activity considering that kids grow up fast. Approaching your child you offer to go to the toys in the central part of the garden. @@.pc;<<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, do you want to play with mommy? Let's have some fun, what do you think?@@<br><br>

<<= setup.selectedChild.name>> looks at you with interest, then half-smiles. Your <<= setup.selectedChild.sexDesc>> is over 2 years old, you feel that time has passed quickly, perhaps more than you would like. @@.npc;Yeah, of course, mommy.@@<br><br>

Your <<= setup.selectedChild.sexDesc>> looks at you with an innocent look, expecting to leave the classroom and start playing, you grab his hand and take him to the toys in the central garden. Several swings and other toys that stimulate children's motor coordination are there, under the constant care of nurses. @@.pc;So, which toy do you prefer?@@<br><br>

You realize that the focus of <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> is on several things, everything seems to attract the attention of children at that age, making it easily distracting. But your <<= setup.selectedChild.sexDesc>> seems to hold your eyes on the big central slide, already being used by some children, curiosity becomes evident and strong in your child's eyes. @@.npc;There!@@<br><br>

<<= setup.selectedChild.name>> innocently points, you let go of his hand and give him the incentive for your <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> to play. @@.pc;You can go, dear. If you need me, I'll be here.@@<br><br>

You grab your phone while <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> takes quick, but still awkward, steps to the swing. You start recording a video for your social networks, while <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> starts to socialize with other children. @@.pc;Hello everyone, especially the young mothers. I want to share this, today I saw that my <<= setup.selectedChild.sexDesc>> is growing fast... It is a strange feeling... I am watching my child grow up fast and I want to remember as much as possible.@@<br><br>

You explain a little of your feelings, but soon you point the camera at <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> while he is socializing and playing on the swing, seems to maintain a somewhat elaborate dialogue, but the mastery of the words and phrases of these children grows day by day. You leave your comments as a background narrator while recording <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, to expose your thoughts.<br><br>

Occasionally <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> looks back at you when you return a smile and continues to encourage your <<= setup.selectedChild.desDesc>> to continue what you are doing. After almost 15 minutes you feel that you have extended the video beyond what you would like, your comments and the moment you lived with your child are recorded as a rock on your social networks, you also hope that this can serve as an inspiration for more mothers pay more attention to their children. After all, the best way to do this is to serve as a good example.<br><br>

The play is far from over, considering the enormous energy of the children, you sit on a bench under shade to watch, you spend a lot of time and the experience is relaxing for you, you can forget about work, duties, and other annoying tasks.<br><br>

You know you can't prolong it infinitely though, after a long time you check your cell phone again to realize that you need to get back to your duties. You approach <<= setup.selectedChild.name>>, which already seems to know your departure, when you kneel yours <<= setup.selectedChild.sexDesc>> changes the expression of laughter and innocent joy to an expression sad. @@.npc;Mommy, are you leaving?@@<br><br>

This is the hardest part, ever. You can see that <<= setup.selectedChild.name>> starts to cry, seeing the tears streaming down your child's face makes you feel a deep weight in your heart. @@.pc;Yes, I need to take care of some things, but I will be back soon. Promise!@@<br><br>

You hug your <<= setup.selectedChild.sexDesc>> affectionately, kissing your child on the forehead at the end before you can get out of there.<br><br><br>
