<<comment "Interestingly enough, unisex toilets being cleaner is a real thing. There is a perception that when it comes to public restrooms, the mens room is dirtier. That's what I thought too until I worked a part-time job as a teenager that occassionally required me to clean the restrooms. So while at home, women tend to leave the restroom cleaner than men, the reverse is true in public restrooms. However, once the restroom is shared with the opposite gender, social pressure comes into play. Men improve their cleanliness a little, but women make a pretty dramatic change, resulting in restrooms that are overall more clean. I am unsure if this effect also works for single-occupant bathrooms though.">>

<p>
The two of you wait for a few minutes before being taken to your seats at a table for two. It stays fairly quiet for a while as the two of you decide on what to order.
</p>
<center><h2>. . .</h2></center>
<p>
Eventually the waitress comes to take your order, and Lily orders first. @@.npc;I'd like the <<= _lil>> please.@@
</p>
<p>
The waitress turns your way and looks at you expectantly. @@.npc;And for you miss?@@
</p>
<p>
You take one last quick glance at the menu to make sure you've got the name right. @@.pc;Yes, I'd like the <<= _tit>> please.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;I'll put that right in for you.@@ The waitress hurries off toward the kitchen, giving the air of an industrious worker as she goes.
</p>
<p>
Lily turns back to you and leans forward with her arms on the table. @@.npc;Okay, I think now's probably a good time to go over our plans. Just keep your voice down, okay?@@
</p>
<p>
You honor Lily's request, answering her in a low voice. @@.pc;Okay... So what exactly are we planning?@@ You give her a questioning look. @@.pc;And if it's secret, why are we talking about it here?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Why, our plans on rebuilding the rejuvenator, of course.@@ Lily looks around at all the other customers eating at <<= _nam>>. @@.npc;And if we talk about it here, surrounded by all this other conversation, it's a lot less likely to be recognizable by snoop algorithms. We're hiding in plain sight.@@
</p>
<p>
<<if â†‚.pc.trait.cl || â†‚.pc.trait.extro>>
@@.pc;Okay... So why are we rebuilding it? Shouldn't we focus on returning me to normal?@@
<br><br>
@@.npc;Because Sherlock, we need to use the rejuvenator to reverse the changes it made to you in the first place. That seems pretty obvious to me.@@
<<else>>
@@.pc;Okay... So I'm assuming that we need the rejuvenator to return me to normal?@@
<br><br>
@@.npc;That's right. If we want to reverse the changes, we need the same device.@@
<</if>>
Lily pauses for a moment before continuing. @@.npc;In any case, it's going to be a lot of work. I have experience from building the first one, which is good, but it's still a huge undertaking. On top of that, there's the cost and special materials...@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;So... what does that mean?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Well, I don't expect you to help pay for it or anything like that. It's... just going to take some time. I can't afford to pay for all the components, it'll probably take at least a year to earn enough money, and that's if I take some risks that might get us discovered.@@
</p>
<p>
You stare pointedly at Lily. @@.pc;You said this was <i>"our"</i> plan, but it sounds like you're doing everything yourself.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Well, it is my mess to clean up, so to speak... There will probably be some times when I could use a hand, perhaps to help acquire some parts, or just to pass me the right tool when I need it. Still, even if you don't want to help at all, I'll get it done eventually.@@ Lily gives you a very serious look. @@.npc;Your job is to stay off the Institute's radar. Seriously. If they find out the even a fraction of what happened to you... let's just say that I won't be able to protect you.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Is is <i>really</i> that big of a deal?@@

<p>
Lily raises her eyebrows at you. @@.npc;Are you serious? <i><b>Of course</b></i> it's that big of a deal. Do you know how valuable the rejuvenator technology would be?@@ She shakes her head @@.npc;Forget the rejuvenator, do you know how valuable a true sex change is?

</p>
<p>
@@.pc;oh...@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Oh is right. Look, it's not going to be easy for someone to realize what happened to you. At most they'll probably think something is fishy about your ID and history, but that isn't exactly unheard of around here. Just don't go around telling people, and it'll probably be fine.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;I really hope so...@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Okay, one last thing. If we need to talk about this in the future, like if I need to ask for your help,we're going to call the device the "boob-tube". So I'll say something like <i>"Hey, can you come give me a hand with the boob tube this weekend?"</i> Got it?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Yeah, I got it... One question though. What the hell is a "boob-tube"?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;It's an old nickname for a television back when they were made out of glass tubes.@@ She looks over toward the kitchen. @@.npc;Looks like our food is ready!@@
</p>
<p>
You look over as well and see that the waitress is indeed approaching your table with your food. Once it's delivered, Lily dives right in, so you start eating as well. It seems like Lily said everything she needed to, so the two of you focus on eating and then let the conversation drift naturally to other topics.

Some time later after Lily has paid the bill for your meal, the two of you head back toward the car.
