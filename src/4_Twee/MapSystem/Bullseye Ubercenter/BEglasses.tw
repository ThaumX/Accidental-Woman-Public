The inside of the clinic looks exactly as you'd expect, with walls covered with glasses displays, and plenty of mirrors. There's a nice little waiting nook with couches and some magazines, and a glassed-in room with machines you assume are there to customize a patient's lenses. You see a fairly handsome man in his late 20s standing behind the reception counter, wearing a doctor's white lab coat.<br><br>He looks up after you walk in, and greets you with a smile. "@@.npc;Welcome to Bat's! Are you a new patient, or did you want to ask about the help wanted sign? I'd be glad to help either way.@@"<br><br>@@.pc;Oh thanks, I am just looking.@@ You look around on various glasses happy that you had a perfect 20/20 sight both prior and after the rejuvenation.<</dialog>><</button>>
