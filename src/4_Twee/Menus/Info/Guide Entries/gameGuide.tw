@@.head2;Oops!@@<br>
It seems like you clicked an info link for a topic that doesn't exist yet. Sorry about that!


:: guideConcept [nobr]

@@.head2;Concept@@<br>
In @@.hotpink;Accidental Woman@@ you play the part of a man temporarily trapped in the body of a woman. You have to live as a woman until your friend can transform you back. Along the way you can advance in your career, meet people, make friends, upgrade your home, get a boyfriend, and of course, have plenty of sex. Available actions for your character will depend on their personality and interactions thus far, and you will be forced to make choices along the way on how to live your accidental life. As with real life, reproduction is a serious concern. You can get pregnant, and you will meet NPCs that will try to knock you up, potentially with underhanded methods. Unlike real life, however, pregnancy can be shortened dramatically, and you won't have to worry about actually taking care of your children. (They will impact your available time each week though!) It's up to you to play the character of your choosing, perhaps an overly shy beauty, or an unattractive woman who wants nothing more than to be swept off her feet by prince charming.


:: guideColorCode [nobr]

@@.head2;Color Coding@@<br>
In order to make the details of the game easier, the text will use color coding to help identify whether something is good, bad, or significant. This can make gameplay faster for those who wish to focus on the ero parts of the game. @@.note;Some of these colors can be customized@@<br>
<br>
@@.import;Yellow text@@ is used to denote something noteworthy.<br>
@@.ident;Bluegreen text@@ is used for names and identifiers.<br>
@@.head;This Color text@@ is used for headings and organization.<br>
@@.money;Yellow-green text@@ indicates a money-related event.<br>
@@.change;Gold text@@ means a change to your body, which could be good or bad.<br>
<br>
@@.good;Lime green text@@ means something good, like getting a promotion.<br>
@@.bad;Red text@@ means something bad, like being injured.<br>
@@.peepgood;Aquamarine text@@ means someone's perception of you has improved.<br>
@@.peepbad;Reddish-orange text@@ means someone's perception of you has gotten worse.<br>
<br>
@@.pc;Light red text@@ is used for the PC's speech.<br>
@@.npc;Light blue text@@ is used for NPC speech.<br>
@@.mono;Light red handwriting@@ is used for the PC's internal monologue.<br>



:: guideSidebar [nobr]

@@.head2;Side Bars (UI Bars)@@<br>
The side bar to the left gives access to some extra functions such as saving and loading. You can save or load the game at any point, though saving while the next scene is loading (generally the main window will be blank) such as processing the end of week changes to NPCs and relationships, is a bad idea! The arrow buttons will allow you to visit/reread previous passages and return to the current passage. Note that using links from a previous passage can cause unintended consequences, and usually does not actually undo a choice you've made. The side bar also displays some relevant information such as the day and time, your available credits, your location, and your status. @@.yellow;You can collapse the side bar@@ to increase the area of the main window. This is helpful for small screens such as cellphones. Finally, the side bar will allow you to access the @@.yellow;Contacts View@@, @@.yellow;Room View@@, and @@.yellow;Status View@@ menus. They show you information about the people you know and relationships, let you check out the relevant people in the room, and see your own status, respectively.



:: guideWeekplanner [nobr]

@@.head2;Week Planner and Summary@@<br>
Time in the game is based on individual @@.yellow;weeks@@. At the start of each week, you will use the week planner to choose your activities for the week. These plans aren't set in stone though, random events may interrupt what you've planned or force you to choose between your original plans or a new activity. When you aren't taking part in a social activity, you'll (usually) be free to move around your home or Appletree.<br><br>
@@.head3;Week Planner@@<br>
In the Week Planner, your primary task will be to choose weekly activities for the available time slots. During the week, much of your day will be occupied by work. Afternoons during the week can be used for several shorter activities such as shopping, cleaning, hanging out with friends, self improvement, or just relaxing. @@.import;(note that most activities will be accomplished by heading to the activity location on the map, which doesn't require planning! Activities, like dates, that require planning/coordination must be scheduled in the week planner.)@@ The weekend gives access to larger activities, and activities that involve staying out late such as going to a bar or club. From the Week Planner, you can also access your @@.yellow;wardrobe@@. Use the wardrobe to create outfits from available clothes based on the activity type. You can let the game choose an appropriate outfit for you, or select your own. <i>Note that choosing a very inappropriate outfit, such as an evening gown for working out at the gym, will likely cause some stares and potentially problems.</i> The Week Planner also gives you access to the @@.yellow;Home Menu@@, which allows you to manage your house's cleanliness, decoration, and also start shopping for a different home. You will also find the @@.yellow;Lifestyle Menu@@, which allows you to control things such as your luxury level for lifestyle expenses, your birth control, and things like medication and diet.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Week Summary@@<br>
The week summary gives you updates on what occurred during the week, such as changes in relationships and finances. It also details information on your health (if something is wrong), pregnancy (if pregnant), your menstrual cycle (if not pregnant), and children (if you have them). The Week Summary is important, but generally does not require any player input.


:: guideClothing [nobr]

@@.head2;Clothing and Outfits@@<br>
Rather than individually write hundreds of different clothing items, clothing is procedurally generated to create numerous items. Clothing is broken up into categories based on where it is worn:<br>
''Headwear:'' Hats, masks, gags, blindfolds, and other novelty items. This category isn't terribly important.<br>
''Footwear:'' Shoes, basically. This game will undoubtedly underrepresent the variety of women's shoe fashion.<br>
''Legwear:'' Things worn on the legs such as stockings and pantyhose. (No effect if wearing long pants!)<br>
''Lower Body:'' Lower clothes such as pants and skirts.<br>
''Upper Body:'' Tops such as blouses, as well as dresses.<br>
''Overwear:'' Items like a sweater, business jacket, or accent pieces.<br>
''Panties:'' Underwear such as briefs, thongs, and others.<br>
''Bras:'' Different kinds of breast coverings.<br><br>
Clothing for each category can have one of many possible styles (button-up blouse, blouse, tee-shirt, tank top, etc.) and several modifying traits such as color/pattern, cut, transparency, etc. These are used to determine the stats of the resulting clothing item. The general stats are: Overall Attractiveness, Sexiness or Cuteness, Casual or Elegant, and Exposure. Sexy clothes tend to be suggestive, and conflicts with cuteness. Sexiness and Exposure are related, but not necessarily the same. Exposure rates how exposed your groin or breasts are while wearing the garment. Additionally, exposure is determined cumulatively. Your exposure will be low, for example, despite wearing no bra and a transparent top if you are wearing a pullover sweater with low exposure over it.
<br><br>
Different clothing items can be selected to form an outfit. Outfits can then be chosen to quickly wear clothes for the situation. Using an outfit to equip clothing is usually faster in in-game time than manually equipping clothing in the wardrobe display.


:: guideInteract [nobr]

@@.head2;Interaction@@<br>
After finishing the opening portion of the game, interaction all takes place using action links. Below the story text, you will be presented with a list of one or more possible actions for you to take. To the right of the action links will be text describing the action in more detail. By using action links, you will choose how you interact with people and other decisions throughout the game.


:: guideRelationships [nobr]

@@.head2;Relationships@@<br>
Your character will build relationships with the NPCs they meet over the course of the game. They can make friends, friends with benefits, lovers, and boyfriends. Relationships are intended to be quite flexible, and based upon your actions. Additionally, you will not be forced into an exclusive relationship; players can have multiple lovers if they so choose. However, if they do form an exclusive relationship with an NPC, there is a chance of your boyfriend finding out about infidelity.
<br><br>
The most important aspect to relationships in Accidental Woman is that they are not static. With the exception of certain special NPCs such as Lily, relationship strength will naturally decay over time if you don't interact with the NPCs you have a relationship with. There are multiple ways to hang out with NPCs, usually depending on the type of relationship involved. The @@.import;Spend Time@@ activity allows you to maintain or improve your relationship with an NPC without spending much player time on the activity. Spend Time will not improve a relationship very much, but does prevent a relationship from decaying. When spending time, you can choose to spend time with multiple friends at the same time. In these cases, the benefit will be spread amongst the relationships involved, and will be affected by how well the different NPCs get along. 


:: guideCheats [nobr]

@@.head2;Cheats and Cheat Mode@@<br>
There are several cheats available to alter your play experience or allow you to focus on a particular aspect of play that you like. It should be noted that using cheats can make the game overly simplistic, particularly if you use several of them. Cheats are generally restricted to Patreon backers to reward their support. There are two types of cheats in the game. The first are cheats that are enabled at game start, and usually have a one-time effect such as increasing starting money. The other is Cheat Mode, which operates through the game and adds potential effects that can be toggled on or off for the week, such as removing relationship decay.

Having a skill over 100 indicates increasing ability, but also has diminishing returns. Each new point in a skill above 100 has less of an impact than the last.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td width=20%>@@.head3;Sex Skill@@</td><td>Generic skill covering your ability to perform in bed (or elsewhere). Important for determining your partner's satisfaction/enjoyment of sex. <i>Improved by having sex, particularly in varied positions and situations.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Oral Skill@@</td><td>Determines your skill at giving oral pleasure, and also impacts your ability to use your hands. Important if you want to successfully give a blowjob; a low skill makes it more likely that your partner will interrupt you. Also important for oral at the gloryhole. <i>Improved by giving oral.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Exhibitionism@@</td><td>Rather than a standard skill, this is more about the level of exhibitionism you're willing to do, and the situations you're willing to do it in. It also governs how effective you are at making it alluring, and your ability to get away with it in very public places. <i>Learned by exhibitionist behavior.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Prostitution@@</td><td>Your ability to perform the oldest profession. This skill relates to several aspects of prostitution, and combined with your sex and oral skills will determine your client's satisfaction and your profit. <i>Learned during the course of prostitution.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td>@@.head3;Communication@@</td><td>A work skill that also impacts non-work relationships to an extent, communication is how well you are able to convey information to coworkers and customers, and generally interact with people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Organization@@</td><td>Is your ability to organize things, ranging from physically organizing your workspace to scheduling tasks or dealing with complex task relationships. It also has a small impact on how messy you are at home.</td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Problem Solving@@</td><td>Your ability to think innovatively and develop solutions for problems. Also relates to your ability to be creative by coming up with new ideas. This work skill also impacts certain areas of your non-work life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Financial@@</td><td>Your understanding of money and accounting, and ability to manage financial transactions in a business environment. Useful in business, but also useful for helping you with your private finances.</td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Aesthetics@@</td><td>A general sense related to understanding what looks good that is involved in a wide range of areas from home decor to style and fashion. <i>Improved by learning: reading magazines, design books, visiting a museum, and other activities.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Athletics@@</td><td>Your overall fitness, endurance, flexibility, and general athletic ability. This is one of the few skills that will decline if not used regularly, though there are plenty of opportunities to use it (the gym, sex, dancing, etc). Reduces the likelihood of illness, and makes it possible to have more sex in more ways. <i>Improved by working out and with vigorous sex.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Dancing@@</td><td>A skill pretty much only useful on the dance floor, having a high level in this skill does improve your appearance on the dance floor. It also lets you do some rather naughty things while ostensibly only dancing. <i>Improved by dancing and taking lessons.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Cleaning@@</td><td>An overlooked but important skill, your cleaning skill determines your ability to clean your residence. This impacts how much cleaning you get done in one action, and the level of cleanliness you can achieve. Many potential partners won't want to stay long if your place is filthy. <i>Improved by spending more time cleaning.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Shopping@@</td><td>Your ability to find the items you want, and to get them at a better price. This impacts all the shopping activities, such as buying clothes or home items, and also affects your living expenses. <i>Improved by shopping.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Cooking@@</td><td>Your ability to make food. Even a low skill can make an acceptable meal, but a high skill means that you can make gourmet food with less time and stress. <i>Improved by study and taking classes, as well as by practice.</i></td></tr>

<br><br>
@@.head2;Inspiration@@<br>
This game was inspired by many games and communities, without which this game likely wouldn't exist:
<br>''TF Game Site'' For providing a portal and repository of games with similar content.
<br>''Trials in Tainted Space (TiTS)'' for showing what is possible with community support and contribution, namely a massive fictional world.
<br>''Free Cities'' for demonstrating the viability of Twine for a complex text-based games.
<br>''Twine Sugarcube'' For providing the engine used by this game to everyone free of charge.
<br>''Trap Quest'' For demonstrating how fun/replayable an erotic game can be with proper game design elements.
<br>''Girl's Life'' From which this game heavily draws inspiration for the scope possible with erotic life simulation games.
<br>''New Life'',  For inspiring a different take on life simulation mechanics (namely choosing weekly activities) that inspired the hybrid approach of Accidental Woman to give more control to the player while removing some of more open life sims.

@@.head2;Thanks!@@
Thanks to everyone who has helped support development of Accidental Woman, whether via Patreon or contribution. Without a community of players that enjoy the game, development would be impossible!



:: guideAbout [nobr]

@@.head1;About the Game@@<br><br>
@@.head3;Accidental Woman@@ is an interactive fiction life sim game for adults. It's built in Twine Sugarcube, and can be played on most OSes and smartphones. In the game, you take the role of a recently single and unemployed man who takes the offer of a longtime friend to move to the secluded town of Appletree. Due to an unfortunate accident, you find yourself completely transformed into a woman, and will have to deal with far more than just transitioning to small-town life!
<br><br>

<br><br>
@@.head2;Different by Design@@<br>
Accidental Woman provides a unique combination of game elements, having the many options and open-world play of a life sim game, but also including rich fiction and numerous plot threads throughout. It features high-quality erotic writing that is written to accommodate the uniqueness of the PC and NPCs, while still allowing control of individual actions in an encounter. The game also features a detailed NPC generator (along with player customization of the generator) and will have an NPC editor that allows players to create custom NPCs to populate Appletree.
<br><br>
The game takes a blended approach to NPCs, with only a few 'fixed' NPCs that stay the same from play-through to play-through. Many of the supporting characters use a blend of fixed and random attributes and stories. The majority of Appletree's people are made up of random generated NPC characters. Unlike most life sim games, however, generated NPCs use a story thread system. The story threads are composed of several elements that are randomly combined into unique stories. These inform the character's behavior and personality, and provide depth to NPCs that are typically only differentiated by appearance and a few personality archetypes in other games.
<br><br>
The idea is to create a life sim game that allows a lot of variety and control over the player character in a richly-detailed world, while providing plenty of opportunities for players to experiment, explore, and challenge themselves with different player characters.
<br><br>
@@.head2;Welcome to Appletree@@<br>
A relatively new town nestled in a small valley and surrounded by old-wood forests, Applewood is a planned community that was build to give employees of the Institute a place to live. Clean and beautiful, Appletree is a paradoxical town that manages to be both idyllic and active at the same time. No matter where you look at the town's calmly refined exterior, there's always something strange, exciting, or both hidden just under the surface. It's probably thanks to the unique people who live there; the scientists, engineers, and other employees who work for the institute.

Players will build relationships and maintain them, and access erotic content within (or outside!) the relationships they've built. By controlling the creation of the player character, and the NPCs that inhabit the world, players can experience numerous scenarios. Perhaps a PC that doesn't want kids, in a world inhabited by NPCs that really want to impregnate her. Maybe a PC who becomes addicted to orgies or cum, or a PC determined to live the high life by becoming a high-class prostitute. A PC may even decide to be a gold digger, dating a wealthy man for his money, while trying to keep her infidelity secret because her boyfriend can't or won't satisfy her. The idea with Accidental Woman is to create a game that makes all these stories--and many more--possible inside an organic simulation.
<br><br>
In the middle of all this, players will struggle with employment and managing their character's life from fashion and home decor to friendship and mental health. Players can guide their character to outstanding success, or watch them devolve into a sex addict with a drug problem. Along the way, they'll deal with the unique circumstances surrounding Appletree, the Institute, and their own Transformation.

<h2>The Wardrobe</h2>
<p>
The wardrobe is the central menu for controlling most of your character's clothing options. From the wardrobe you can view clothing items, wear them, donate them, and see their stats. You can also save and modify outfits, allowing clothing to be equipped easily (particularly outside of the wardrobe menu), and view the overall characteristics of your outfit.

:: guideGrooming [nobr]

The Grooming Menu is where you can control the finer points of your appearance. Some of these options are purely customization for personal preference, while others like makeup and hairstyle have more of an impact on your attractiveness. While body hair is generally in the personal preference category, and ThaumX makes no judgement personally about what people choose to do with their hair, visible leg/underarm hair ''will'' have a minor negative effect on your attractiveness stat because of the social mores in North America.
<br>''Hair''--This is where you can change your hairstyle and your hairstyle presets. You can also see which hair styles you have learned.
<br>''Face''--This is essentially makeup, because Face fit better into the button than Makeup did. You'll be able to change makeup here, as well as your makeup presets. You can also practice and learn new makeup styles in front of the mirror, and control any face-based grooming regimens.
<br>''Wear''--This is where you control the jewelry that you wear. Menstrual products are worn automatically, and accessories are controlled in the wardrobe menu. This menu <i>may</i> be expanded with a wider range of style/decoration-based wearables in the future.
<br>''Other''--This is where you control all the other stuff! Actually, this page mainly deals with body hair, pubic hair styling, and brushing your teeth.

Some makeup is harder to put on than others, and takes different amounts of time to accomplish. While it's unlikely to take quite so long in AW, professionals often take about 60 minutes to apply makeup on customers for special events. Usually the fancier, more attractive styles take longer to do. Unlike hairstyles, observing a makeup style once is enough to learn how to attempt it. However, applying makeup takes a certain level of skill, and isn't quite so easy to master! Whenever you apply makeup there is a skill check to see how well you do. (Unless your aesthetics skill is high enough to bypass that style's check.) You can succeed, and have well-applied makeup. You can do poorly, which doesn't make you look bad, but usually has significantly lowered benefit.

Hairstyles differ in several ways beyond simply how they look or how attractive they are. Some are harder to learn than others, for one thing, and they take different amounts of time to accomplish.

When you pay a stylist at a salon to style your hair, you will watch and attempt to learn how to accomplish that hairstyle on your own. This means a skill check with your aesthetics skill. If your skill check roll is high enough (higher aesthetics helps), you'll learn the style permanently. This means that a character with low aesthetics can learn a very complicated hairstyle, but that it may take numerous attempts. It also means that a skilled pc may fail to learn a hairstyle due to a bad roll. You can keep trying as many times as your funds and time allow, though you'll need to change your hairstyle to something else before making another attempt.@@

:: guideClothingStats [nobr]

@@.head3;Clothing Stats@@<br><br>
The stats or attributes of a piece of clothing are based on its style, substyle, fabric, and to a lesser degree color. However, these stats are not always the same. The style, substyle, fabric, and color do not add or subtract a fixed amount from clothing stat values. Instead, each has a weighted random range of values to add or subtract. This means that two otherwise identical clothing items are very unlikely to have the same stats. This mimics clothing in real life, where small differences in style/design impact how good it looks. (Basically, not all black satin demi-cup bras look the same.)
<br><br>
The price of clothing is based on the type of clothing and its attributes, and there is a multiplier to change the price based on the store. Pricing is done outside the clothing generator to allow for things like sales. Currently, there is no randomness in the price of clothing, it is entirely deterministic.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Anatomy of a Clothing Variable@@<br>
Each clothing item--except for bags/purses and accessories--has 11 values in its array when created, and then 12 when purchased. (The 12th being the purchase price.) This gives us rich information about the clothing that can be used during play in a number of ways.

The most interesting to you is likely @@.exp;Exposure@@ and @@.exp;Status@@.<br><br>
@@.head3;Exposure@@ is a numerical value representing how exposed relevant body parts are. In the case of a bras, blouses, and overwear, this is how exposed the breasts are. The scale goes from 0-completely covered, to 5-completely exposed. The areas in-between allow for different levels of exposure. a low value may allow people to detect hard nipples, while a high value may be thin and sheer so that it hardly hides anything. Exposure is also affected by the "protection" a garment gives. An ultrasheer shirt may allow you to see everything, but wouldn't let you touch it directly, so doesn't have an exposure value of 5. In addition, exposure works based on the cumulative level of exposure for all the garments covering that part of the body. You can be wearing a cupless bra, and a transparent latex shirt, but your exposure level would still be extremely low if you were wearing a sweatshirt over those. (Unless you pulled the sweatshirt off, or hiked it up over your chest.)<br><br>
@@.head3;Status@@ is a coded value, and is probably the neatest or most original mechanic when it comes to clothes in AW. Each clothing item has a range of possible status values based on the style, substyle, and fabric values. The status of a garment affects its primary stats. For example, a thin cotton tee-shirt would normally have a relatively-low exposure value, but could have that modified to be higher by being wet. A skirt could be hiked up, a shirt could be unbuttoned, panties can be pulled aside, or jeans could be unbuttoned, unzipped, and worn quite low. The value is coded to allow multiple status effects at the same time, such as being wet, torn, and unfastened all at once.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Cuteness/Sexiness@@ is a numerical value representing how cute or sexy a clothing item is. While it doesn't affect attractiveness strongly, it does have an impact on the perception of NPCs, along with your chosen persona and other factors.

:: guideSurgery [nobr]

@@.head3;Surgery Information@@<br><br>

There are lot's of options to get a cosmetic surgery treatment in the Appletree but main place to get them is a Dollmaker Clinic in the Outpatient Area of the Medical district. Options are separated into number of various groups e.g. "boobs surgeries". Note that every plastic surgery needs a full anesthesia so it will start a sleep cycle and you will lose the end of the current day. You can't do operations in a row, each one results in some rehabilitation period, luckily it is pretty short due to the technologically-advanced level of the Appletree surgeons.

Most options says for themselves, but you should take into account that any kind of breast reduction can cause the change of the breast shape. WHich can be fixed later with an additional operation. Another thing to be aware of is the option to install a brand new patented "Expand+" implants which allows you to gradually enlarge your breasts with a simple injection to the implants once it was set in during the operation.

Some things can't be achieved with only the lancet though. For some more extreme mods you probably would like to consider visiting the genetic transformatives companies in the Medical district. 


:: guideNutrition [nobr]

@@.head3;Nutrition Information@@<br><br>
Nutrition system in AW is a system calculating your character body weight and muscle mass. It mainly depends on the two main parameters: 1. How much food you ate. 2. How much workout you did over the week.

The important part is that eating is happening in a full-auto mode without forcing you to feed your character manually. At the beginning of each week you can choose your food spendings, it will affect your week spendings on food and the potential weight and health outcome for your character. Note, that cheaper options will actually push your character to <i>more</i> obsessive state and pricey options are more about "healthy" natural food and won't probably make your character fat as fast. The second way of getting additional calories is eating at various restaurants and fast-food places over the town. The rule of thumb is that every time game mentions your character ate something you probably got some calories.

Muscles never get any boost to grow until you intentionally do any kind of workout\jogging\swimming activity. The harder the exercise is the more your character will get to her "incoming muscle mass" at the end of the week. Abstaining of any fitness activity will cause your muscles slowly disappear over time until you end up in a "frail" state.

At the end of each week game does some complicated math like actually calculating your character BMI, real weight in kg and many other things to determine if you got enough of muscle mass gain/muscle mass loss/fat gain/fat loss to pass any of the borderlines. The effect actually sums up so you can work out a lot one week and then add just a tiny bit the next one and it will be enough to get from "average" to "toned" as an example, same goes with body fat. 

A good way to control your body tone\weight situation is using home scales which you can buy in Bullseye's home electronic section.


:: guideWeight [nobr]

@@.head3;Weight Information@@<br><br>
Weight information in Accidental Woman is based on the Body Mass Index, or BMI. You can read more about [[BMI here|https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html]].

It's also not intended as a value statement about people's weight. Weight (and losing it) is a challenging topic that is beyond the scope of this game. In addition, normal is just a descriptive word, and doesn't indicate actual normality.<br><br>Male and female weight labels differ on values 3 and 4 because of differences in anatomy and cultural appearance standards. Both levels are within the healthy 'appropriate weight' range. ''Value 3''' indicates a low enough weight that muscle definition is easily visible, such as well-formed 'six-pack' abs. For women this is an athletic/lithe look, though because it emphasizes muscles the appearance changes dramatically with the amount of muscle mass. Interestingly enough, medical research has found this weight to be unhealthy in the long term, with higher mortality and incidence of disease. ''Value 4'' indicates a more natural amount of body fat. In males this amount of fat obscures muscle somewhat, making a clearly defined 'six-pack' difficult. In women this is the amount of fat needed for a smooth, curvy appearance, and is the most traditionally beautiful. Think soft, rather than pudgy, and you'll be on the right track.

:: guideHeight [nobr]

@@.head3;Height Information@@
<br><br>
Height information in Accidental Woman is based on statistical medical data for the United States. While using percentiles of height might not always match people's perception of what is 'very tall' or 'very short', it is more useful to base height standards on this information. This is because setting very tall and very short to higher and lower values respectively would result in very few NPCs fitting into that category, and making the preference generally useless. NPCs are generated with statistical distributions mirroring real life. Because of this, extreme values are rarely encountered.
<br><br>
Additionally, I am using the distribution for white people. This is because it is relatively average, and relates well to distributions in other countries. The African American distribution is actually very similar to the white distribution, in fact slightly shorter on average, but stretches much higher at the extreme tall end of the spectrum. (0.1 percentile). Anyways, please don't take this as a racist perspective. I may add support or patches for editing these values much later in development.

Happiness is yet another important stat of your character. It is pretty obvious you will want to keep it as high as possible, low level of happiness leads your character to the depression and eventually the suicide. Managing happiness is not a tough business though.

• Be sure you furnished your home well enough with furniture, posters, decorations and other stuff. Living in an empty flat without a bed will surreally lead your character to the edge pretty fast.
• Stay away of drugs and if you got into drugs already, keep 'em coming on a steady rate and don't allow your character to get a withdrawal.
• Do what your char likes to do. Any kind of fun activity like dating, hangouts, dancing, fucking and other make your character happy.
• Keep in mind your character traits and kinks. The character with a "Maternal" trait will be happy to feel her baby kicking inside. Having a creampie will be a sad experience for the character without a "Risky" kink and so on.

• Another options are having sex, masturbating, enjoying all kinds of recreational activity like swimming in the pool. Think of the thing you personally would like to do to get rid of stress in your life and just guide your character to do the same thing.

Stress can be caused by a wide range of various events and situations:

• Working, especially putting a lot of effort into your performance.
• Running late for work.
• Being raped.
• Getting into embarrassing situations.
• And many more.

Note that your character's traits affect the stress a lot.

<dt>Caring/Uncaring:</dt>
<dd>A caring person is likely to be more empathetic, and more likely to be bothered by other people's problems. An uncaring person isn't overly bothered by the misfortune of others.</dd>

<dt>Bitch/Kind:</dt>
<dd>A bitch is more likely to stand up for herself, but also can be harsh and annoying to people. A Kind person is more likely to get along with others, but also more likely to be taken advantage of.</dd>

<dt>Maternal/Bad With Kids:</dt>
<dd>A maternal person has a natural ability with children, and finds taking care of them easier. Someone who is bad with kids is the opposite of this, and seems to have a hard time dealing with children.</dd>

<dt>Romantic/Aromantic:</dt>
<dd>A romantic person falls in love easier, but is also affected more strongly by breakups and relationships. An aromantic person finds it difficult to fall in love, but does not suffer many negative effects from failing romantic relationships.</dd>

<dt>Deceptive/Honest:</dt>
<dd>A deceptive person is naturally good at lying, and can use deception more effectively (for good or bad). An honest person is bad at lying, and will likely be seen to be more trustworthy, but will also find it difficult to be dishonest when necessary.</dd>

<dt>Devious/Straight-Forward:</dt>
<dd>A devious or Machiavellian person is more likely to be manipulative to achieve her objectives, though can also devise schemes that end up benefiting everyone. A devious person is also better at recognizing the motives and schemes of others. A straight-forward person seems easier to deal with, and often times can be seen as more likeable or trustworthy. They also have a hard time recognizing the deception and schemes of others.</dd>

<dt>Persuasive/Follower:</dt>
<dd>A persuasive person is able to convince others to go along with their wishes, though this can have a negative effect on relationships if they always get their way. A follower is a person who is easily influenced, and goes along with the wishes and actions of others. This rarely hurts a relationship, but also means that they are more likely to be pushed toward an action they don't want to take.</dd>

<dt>Perceptive/Oblivious:</dt>
<dd>A perceptive person pays more attention to details and is more likely to spot something unusual or notice when something is wrong. An oblivious person is the opposite, remaining largely blind to details and problems. They do say, however, that ignorance is bliss.</dd>

<dt>Forgetful/Good Memory:</dt>
<dd>A pretty simple trait, a forgetful person is more likely to forget something important, while a person with a good memory is more likely to remember important tasks. Memory relates much more to non-routine tasks like appointments or work activities than it does to routine tasks like taking medication each day.</dd>

<dt>Low Self-Esteem/Narcissistic:</dt>
<dd>A person with low self-esteem doesn't view themselves as very valuable. They are more prone to negative mental effects, and more likely to find themselves stuck in a bad relationship. A narcissistic person values themselves too much, and can have trouble forming strong relationships, romantic or otherwise, with other people.</dd>

<dt>Forgiving/Holds Grudges:</dt>
<dd>A forgiving person is more likely to forgive mistakes or malicious actions of others, and can avoid a lot of negative emotional effects. They are also more likely to be hurt repeatedly. A person who holds grudges has a hard time forgiving, and can have excessive negative emotional consequences from betrayal. They are unlikely to be hurt repeatedly.</dd>

<dt>Picky/Low Standards:</dt>
<dd>A picky person has very high standards, and can have difficulty meeting people that are 'good enough' for them. A person with low standards finds people more attractive on average, but also can end up settling when they could do better.</dd>

<dt>Crude/Refined:</dt>
<dd>A crude person is less aware of manners and social mores, and some people can find them rude or offensive. They are unlikely to be put off by natural bodily functions or other crude people. Refined people have a good understanding or manners and politeness, but are easily upset by crude behavior.</dd>

<dt>Friendly/Unfriendly:</dt>
<dd>A friendly person finds it easier to start and strengthen relationships with people, but can also be seen as being fake or less genuine by some. An unfriendly person finds it harder to start and strengthen relationships, but is also seen to be more genuine and honest when it comes to relationships.</dd>

<dt>Approachable/Unapproachable:</dt>
<dd>An approachable person has a certain appearance that makes them seem safer to start a conversation with. They are more likely to be hit on, and often valued more, but conversely have to deal with unwanted advances. Unapproachable is essentially the opposite.</dd>

<dt>Relaxed/Ambitious:</dt>
<dd>A relaxed person is generally happy with their place in life, and is unlikely to receive much stress from work or financial matters. An ambitious person is more likely to succeed financially, but also deals with greater stress in this area.</dd>

<dt>Materialistic/Hippy:</dt>
<dd>A materialistic person really appreciates the finer things in life, and gains more benefit from having luxuries. They also are more greatly affected by not having luxuries. A hippy gains little benefit from luxury, but also doesn't lose much from poorer conditions.</dd>

<dt>Flirty/Shy:</dt>
<dd>A flirty person is naturally flirty and intimate, and is good at encouraging a romantic interest to make a move. A shy person has a hard time opening themselves up with new people, sometimes giving a romantic interest the impression that they aren't interested.</dd>

@@.head2;Sexual Kinks@@
<br><br>
<dl class="heads">
<dt>Oral:</dt>
<dd> Enjoys giving oral sex, or is at least willing to do so. Unchecking this box indicates that you dislike giving oral sex, and will never offer it yourself. This doesn't mean that a partner won't 'strongly encourage' you to go down on them.</dd>

<dt>Bare Sex:</dt>
<dd> You really enjoy bare and/or risky sex, and like the feeling of receiving a creampie. You will find sex that ends in a creampie (whether accidental or intentional) to be more fulfilling. This doesn't include an urge to get pregnant, just a certain amount of risk, and you'll still want partners to pull out or use condom on risky days. This will not remove your worry about potential pregnancy or disease if applicable.</dd>

<dt>Cumslut:</dt>
<dd> More than simply liking oral sex, you have a strong like of semen. You will find it easier to perform intense oral, and will receive satisfaction from swallowing semen and other acts involving cum. You tend to find larger balls more attractive.</dd>

<dt>Submissive:</dt>
<dd> You are naturally submissive, and dislike taking the lead in sexual encounters. This will limit some sexual activities, but you will find aggressive partners more satisfying.</dd>

<dt>Easy to Please:</dt>
<dd> You are more sensitive than normal, and you find it easier than average to achieve orgasm (and multiple orgasms).</dd>

<dt>Anal:</dt>
<dd> Enjoys anal sex, or is at least willing to have it. Unchecking this box indicates that you dislike anal sex, and will never offer it yourself. This doesn't mean that a partner won't try, or that you won't get surprise buttsex.</dd>

<dt>Pregnancy:</dt>
<dd> You are strongly aroused by pregnancy and the concept of breeding. Unlike simply liking bare sex, you are far more likely to seek and engage in pregnancy-risk sex, and if the two are combined may even be willing to circumvent your partner's attempts at birth control to enjoy risky sex. You do not suffer worry about potential pregnancy, but can still become worried about disease if applicable. You tend to find large testicles more attractive.</dd>

<dt>Size Queen:</dt>
<dd> You have an obsession with large cocks, finding them much more attractive than normal, and have a dislike of average to small cocks. You will find sex with average equipment less satisfying and less likely to get you off, but will have little difficulty handling large equipment.</dd>

<dt>Dominant Streak:</dt>
<dd> You have a natural preference or aptitude for being dominant. This doesn't instantly make you a masterful dom as soon as you find a sub partner though.</dd>

<dt>Sensitive Nipples:</dt>
<dd> Your nipples are more sensitive than normal, and you find it <b>far</b> easier to orgasm from nipple play. You also get a lot more enjoyment out of general breast play and activities like tit fucking.</dd>

<dt>Forced:</dt>
<dd> The most popular female fantasy based on empirical research, and the subject of most novels of the romance genre, forced is when you are forced into a sexual situation ranging from a kiss to full intercourse. Unchecking this box indicates that you are completely opposed to any forced situations, even with a loving partner and/or via roleplay.</dd>

<dt>Exhibitionist:</dt>
<dd> You enjoy the thrill of exhibitionism, and are more willing to wear revealing clothes in public. Your Exhibitionism skill will increase more rapidly, but so will your arousal from exhibitionism.</dd>

<dt>Buttslut:</dt>
<dd> A more extreme version of likes anal, you really enjoy anal sex. You receive significantly more satisfaction from anal, but will be unhappy with a partner that isn't willing to have anal frequently enough.</dd>

<dt>Bondage:</dt>
<dd> You find bondage activity enjoyable, or are at least willing to participate. This acts as a 'soft gate' to bondage content. Not checking this box won't eliminate content with light or minor bondage, but will avoid more intense bondage play.</dd>

<dt>Rape Fetish:</dt>
<dd> You have strong fantasies about hardcore rape. Sexual assault and rape is unlikely to harm you much mentally, but you are also more likely to encounter such situations due to risky behavior tied to this fetish.</dd>

<dt>Watersports:</dt>
<dd>Enjoys watersports (pee), or is at least willing to participate. Unchecking this box indicates that you dislike watersports, and will never get involved voluntarily.</dd>

<dt>Public Sex:</dt>
<dd> You really enjoy sexual activity in public, finding it far more thrilling than normal. You get a lot more satisfaction than normal from sex in public. You also find it difficult to resist temptation in a public setting.</dd>

<dt>Liberated:</dt>
<dd> You realize that sex doesn't have to be connected to love and relationships, and find satisfaction in casual sex. This also means that you don't have any problem with prostitution, and you tend to enjoy the activity more. Your prostitution skill will increase more rapidly, though your attitudes may be a turn off to some NPCs of a romantic persuasion.</dd>

<dt>Masochist:</dt>
<dd> You enjoy pain, and find it sexually arousing. At this time, this doesn't do much. <i>If more content is desirable it can be added, but it's a little outside my ability to write effectively. I've done some experimentation personally, but it wasn't for me. I just can't wrap my head around it well enough to write it.</i></dd>

<dt>Slut:</dt>
<dd> You ''LOVE'' sex, and are basically willing to do anything. You get a ''lot'' more satisfaction from extreme sex and activities like orgies and gloryholes, and have no problem with prostitution. You start high on the 'sex addiction' stat and gain it quicker, but also suffer less from humiliation and other negative social input. You can cure a bad day at the office easily, if you can avoid nymphomania. ''Warning--Choosing this trait automatically enables some other "okay" traits! (oral, anal, force, bondage, exhibition)'' <i>Characters who follow the path of sexual hedonism will eventually find this trait added later, and eventually the 'Superslut' trait. Your starting libido will also be quite high.</i></dd>

<dt>Hard to Please:</dt>
<dd> It's more difficult than normal for you to reach orgasm. <i>This makes it harder to keep yourself satisfied.</i></dd>

<dt>Fapper:</dt>
<dd> You really enjoy a good fap, and get a little more satisfaction from it. Your expert touch has made normal encounters less pleasurable, and you find normal sex less satisfying.</dd>

<dt>Shamefast:</dt>
<dd> For whatever reason, you find sexual activities to be shameful or wrong. You never really let yourself enjoy it, so sexual activities of all kinds are less satisfying. Additionally, you have feelings of guilt afterwards, so are usually less happy after giving in to your urges. ''This is not easy.''</dd>

The social support for the unemployed is less than ideal, particularly in the United States, but has managed to stave off the collapse of the economy.
<span id="youtubers"></span></li>
<li>Part of the government's solution to unemployment are massive public works projects and other forms of government employment, similar to the twentieth century's New Deal programs, but on a larger scale.</li>
<li>The unacknowledged part of the solution is a series of seemingly never-ending proxy wars in various parts of the world. Several power blocs are involved in one way or another, cooperating or opposing each other based on a nearly indecipherable set of objectives and treaties. There is no uniform draft in the United States, but enrolling in an unemployment program could mean compulsory service.</li>
<li>Because of all this, people are willing to put up with a lot more from their employers, and labor conditions have declined markedly in all levels of employment. New legislation has prevented wages from plummeting, but most people are simply happy to have steady-if stagnant-wages.</li>
<li>Overpopulation, which was dismissed in the 1990s as an actual concern, has stayed in the public consciousness to the current day. (//The Netflix movie "Where's Monday" was based on the concept.//) The actual trend over the previous decades has been the opposite, and this carries on into Accidental Woman's setting. The population crash, or population collapse, is already making itself known in Europe. Japan started the trend a little bit earlier than the West, but their strict controls on immigration have made the decline more visible. European countries (and the U.S.) have supplemented the population with immigrants. ''I make no political claims about immigration being good or bad.'' Rapid demographic changes, however, have not turned out well historically (up to the present day). Europe contains many good examples of some of the issues being faced, and the German government estimates that by 2050 less than 50% of the German population will be ethnically European.</li>

<ul style="list-style-type:square" class="gab">
<li>Appletree is an unusual place, and part of that is caused by the prosperity and newness of the town that contrasts with most other areas in the country. Residents tend to maintain a deliberate ignorance about anything that might upset their view of the town or the Institute.</li>
<li>The Institute, awash in government money, pays its employees well, and this creates opportunity for other businesses in the area. The homeless and other unwanted people aren't allowed to remain in town, though most assume they are simply deported.</li>
<li>The local government is essentially run by the Institute, making it the perfect picture of a "company town". Laws tend to be a lot more fluid, particularly with the town's extraterritorial status, and civil liberties often have more to do with a citizen's importance than most people would feel comfortable with.</li>
<li>These unique factors combined with a population composed mainly of scientists and engineers makes Appletree a very liberated town sexually, and gives it something of a bohemian atmosphere. Some of the few morality laws that do exist seem to be only selectively enforced, and if anything, the Institute seems to be encouraging a more sexualized population.</li>

:: guideBreastVars [nobr]

@@.head3;Breast Variables@@
<br><br>
The breast size guide contains more information about breast variables. The short version is that characters with breasts have two variables that determine their bra size. 1) volume in cubic centimeters. 2) band size in inches. (//Note that because nobody uses actual centimeter values for band size, this is not converted to metric//)
<br><br>
Band size is determined by a combination of weight and shoulder width, while volume is a base statistic that remains the same unless the character gains/loses weight during the game, or becomes pregnant.
<br><br>
Size is reported in two ways, either the bra size //like 32F// or in a raw cup size that is based entirely on volume and a 34 inch band //like E-cup//. Bra size is more representative of appearance, while the raw cup size is a way to describe volume alone. //saying 'large D-cup' is a lot easier to understand than saying 680cc!// This value is only rarely used, and primarily because it is more representative for certain gameplay elements like lactation. To convert between the raw cup and bra cup sizes, simply subtract 1 cup size for every 2 inches larger band size, or add 1 cup size for every 2 inches smaller band size.

''C-Strings'' are very different from typical panties, usually being rigid and springy. They are intended to provide the vulva coverage of a G-string, but give the outward appearance of not wearing panties at all, as there is no waist to create a waistline. The front/crotch of the C-string ranges in size from fully covering the pubic mound (similar to a low-front G-string) to only covering the bottom of the pubic mound to be able to stay in place. Because they are held in place by a springy clamping action, they are less comfortable. This means that they are usually worn for sex appeal rather than fashion necessity.

Crotchless panties are intended to be sexy, and thus are usually found on more revealing panty styles. The crotch of crotchless panties are rarely gusseted, and are therefore thin. They start with having a slit down the middle for 'access purposes' while generally containing the inner labia. These can often be indistinguishable from normal lingerie panties at a glance.

''Adhesive Bra'' is a bandless and strapless bra that sticks to the breasts. In the case of larger breasts, these resemble pasties for modesty. For medium to smaller breasts, they can also pull the breasts together and create cleavage. The most common type of adhesive bra is made of silicone but there are ones that are made of foam.

A ''Balconette Bra'' is an offshoot from the demi cup bra, which basically means the cups are low to allow you to wear fairly low cut clothing. A balconette bra usually has a more of a horizontal line along the top of the cups, and has a top-line just above the nipple. Balconette has become a loosely used term, and it is often misused or confused with a balcony bra (normally called a shelf bra). Balconette bras have a horizontal top line, very low cut cups that just over the areola, underwires, and widely set straps. @@.note;A balconette bra is sometimes called a half-cup bra, as they are very similar.

A ''Bandeau Bra'' is shaped like a strip over the breasts, sometimes with ruching in the middle. They are kind of a cross between a strapless bra and a tube top. They are made of stretchy fabric so don’t normally have a fastening in the back, instead they go on over the head. Like many strapless bras, they often come with detachable straps so you can wear them with or without.
<br><br>
As there is little to no shaping, this isn’t a supportive bra, it becomes increasingly provocative with larger breasts. There are variations of bandeau bras that have wires and padding to give more lift but a classic bandeau bra is really just a strip of stretchy fabric, and can be really comfy to wear. The bandeau shape has been used in tops and bikinis for a long time, so unlike most bras they don’t have to strictly be underwear, often they are worn to show under clothes for a layered effect, and could even be worn as a decorative tube top.

A ''Contour Bra'' has cups that have been shaped by machine to fit the shape of the breasts. There is often confusion between contour and molded bras, and the terms are frequently used--incorrectly--interchangeably. Contour bra cups are shaped from fabric and a sturdy layer of foam, they will hold their shape whether they are on or off. the fixed shape of the contour bra give breasts a more shapely and smooth silhouette, and also adds the appearance of greater volume. The layer of foam also prevents even very-large nipples from showing through clothing, so they are popular for that reason too.

''Demi-Cup Bra'' ‘Demi’ describes a style of cup shape for a bra. It has a low cut like a balconette, and only just comes up over the nipple. It usually covers more of the breast than the balconette because of the angled cut. It has straps that are widely set, though not as wide as a balconette on average, and usually plunges quite low in the middle to show cleavage. Because the top of the cups are low and the straps are far apart demi cup bras are great for low cut, scoop neck or wide necklines.

''Full Cup Bra'' The cups on a full cup bra completely cover the breasts. They offer the most support of any type of bra. As they are designed for women who want more support and comfort, the shoulder straps are usually wider too. The main downside to full cup bras is that they will be visible with any top that comes down even slightly low. They are not generally attractive on their own due to the functional shape, but thin versions with sheer fabric choices can make a full cup bra rather appealing. @@.note;Sports bras are oftentimes full cup bras, but differences in shape, structure, and fabrics make it a distinct style.@@

A ''Molded Cup Bra'' has fabric that has been shaped over a breast mold to give it a pre-defined breast shape.  Fabric with synthetic fibers is stretched over a hot mold form, a second hot piece comes down on top of it and molds the former flat piece of fabric into the shape of a breast.  this piece is now the bra cup and is sewn into a bra frame.  Usually, the fabric is seamless, but molded cups can also contain seams – this gives added support. A molded bra is usually made with a single piece of fabric or has a second layer for opacity and additional strength. It is the ultimate light-weight bra for a woman who wants to feel and look like she’s wearing nothing, but wants the support of a bra. A molded cup bra is often sheer, and does little to disguise nipples below clothing.

An ''Open Cup Bra'' or cupless bra has no cup, and consists primarily of an underwire. The underwire, band, and straps serve to frame and shape the breast, and can be worn in place of a traditional bra to look braless under clothes but with improved shape and cleavage. As breasts get larger the strength of this effect decreases, and they become more decorative rather than enhancing shape. They are also used in sexy or naughty lingerie and fetish clothing, though these versions often make no attempt at shaping the breast.

A ''Peephole Bra'' is a bra that has an opening over the nipple. The most common variant of this is intended more as lingerie or sleepwear, and has no underwire with a simple cloth cup split in two. @@.note;pictured@@ Other versions of the peephole bra come complete with underwire and support for regular wear. Some even have a piece of very-thin sheer fabric over the nipple to prevent chafing. This style can provide support and comfort while encouraging nipple outlines to be very visible under clothing, or even be actually visible with a sheer top. This can be used as a technique to make it seem like a bra is not being worn and that the breasts are naturally shapely, or simply to show off the nipples. These bras also have some popularity for short-term wear for the stimulation of the shirt fabric rubbing against the nipple.

''Plunge Bras'' are designed to allow wearing low-cut clothes without the bra showing. The cups join together low between the breasts, with a thin center piece. Usually the shoulder straps are wide to allow widely-cut necklines as well. Plunge bras are not padded, which makes them distinct from push-up bras, which commonly have cups joined low between the breasts.

''Push-up Bras'' do exactly what they say, they push the breasts up and together to give maximum cleavage. They are often similar to plunge bras as well, with the cups joined low between the breasts so that clothes can be worn low to show them off. Push-up bras are padded so that breasts can appear a couple of cup sizes larger than they are. Some will have removable padding or inserts, in other ones the padding will be built in. Some even contain gel padding that will adjust to the wearer's shape and give the look and feel of real breasts. For larger-breasted women, push-up bras are made without padding that still squeeze and push the breasts together and upward. @@.note;Padded bras still exist, but have largely been replaced by push-up bras for most breast sizes, as padded bras tend to look increasingly fake with size.

A ''Shelf Bra'' is also known as a platform bra, quarter-cup bra or balcony bra. It has underwires and supports from underneath, but has  very short cups designed to expose your breasts. The shelf bra has strong rigid cups and a sturdy band, and acts quite literally like a shelf for the breasts. Starting from the inter-mammary fold, the breast rests on the cup that extends outward. The slope of the cup determines the breast shape, and can range from nearly horizontal for a stronger push-out or protruding effect, to being curved almost like a normal bra cup for smaller breasts without a significant inter-mammary fold. For medium to large breasts, many start horizontally and taper into a curve for a more shapely appearance while still pushing the breasts outward. Shelf bras leave the nipples completely exposed, and the outward protrusion of the breasts can make them appear significantly larger, particularly for breasts that are already sizable.

''Sports Bras'' are designed to give support during physical activity. They are just about the only bra that serves more than a fashion function, though they are worse for the wearer's health than normal bras if worn for longer than very short periods. There are different types of sports bras that are designed for different activities. A sports bra for yoga will be comfortable and offer greater movement, whereas one for jogging will be firm enough to remove bounce. The shape of sports bras can vary greatly. A racer back is quite common as it gives the wearer's arms and shoulders a good range of motion, the straps can’t fall down, and they can be quite supportive. Some sports bras have underwires, particularly those intended to be worn without a shirt, or those in larger cup sizes. Sports bras no longer need to be plain or unattractive, there are a large variety of attractive or even sexy variants available.
<br><br>
There are two main ways that a sports bra functions, and many modern bras offer a mix of the two methods. The encapsulation method has full molded cups that separate and hold each breast in place individually. These look more like a standard bra. The difference is a standard bra primarily supports from underneath, while encapsulation means the cup should offer support from every direction to reduce any movement while exercising. These are the healthier option, but also require better fitting and do not function as well as the compression type.
<br><br>
Compression bras are made with stretchy fabric and are tight to compress the breasts. This type doesn’t traditionally have cups and usually lacks a clasp or opening. The compression squeezes the breasts, holding them in place during vigorous motion. These are most commonly recommended for those who have become dependent on breast support due to atrophy, as they strongly restrict any movement of the breasts. @@.note;Shown are three sports bras in increasing levels of attractiveness, followed by an encapsulation-style sports bra, and compression style sports bra intended for vigorous exercise.@@

They can be held up by friction in the case of tighter stockings with elasticity. Finer stockings made of silk or other less stretchy fabrics often have an elastic or stretch lace band at the top to hold them up. Some stockings (garter stockings) have a thicker strip of fabric at the top so that they can be clipped to a garter belt.

They are often confused with bustiers, but are easy to tell apart.

Some tube tops have strong elastic straps and other addons to provide support for larger breasts similar to a strapless bra. <b>They shouldn't be worn with a bra</b>, and because of their elastic nature of hugging the body, they can be very revealing of the shape of the breasts and outline of the nipples. Thinner fabric varieties have a very erotic look because of this, but are still considered acceptable for casual wear.

A ''Bustier Top'' is a form-fitting garment based on a more traditional bustier, which is usually worn as lingerie.

The top variant is intended to be worn as outerwear, and may or may not maintain an elaborate lingerie styling. This top has no straps, and <b>is worn without a bra</b>. It pushes the breasts up, out, and together, creating a large amount of visible cleavage. The cups of a bustier top are cut similar to a balconette bra, and are made of a firm material that extends lower into the garment for support. Because there are no straps and firm cups, the wearer has to be careful of movement that will expose the nipple. They also need to regularly check the garment while wearing, as the squeezing push-up nature of the cups can cause the breasts to ride up and eventually expose the areola or even the nipple. Finally, wearers have to be careful of bending over too far, as doing so will usually cause the breasts to fall out of the garment.

Linen is laborious to manufacture, but the fiber is very absorbent and garments made of linen are valued for their exceptional coolness and freshness in hot weather. Depending on the weave of the fabric, it can range from being moderately sheer to completely opaque. In AW, Linen refers to the opaque variety.

''Sheer Linen'' is a very cool and light-weight fabric, though it feels rougher or more course than other sheer fabrics when new. After some wear, it becomes very soft and comfortable. Unlike most other materials used in sheer fabrics, linen handles moisture far better.

''Lingerie Mesh'' is commonly used in panties, creating breathable, light and sheer panels. It is a light and delicate fabric that does not add much bulk, and can be used to provide light linings in bralettes, nighties, or panties. As a moderately open mesh made with thin (typically nylon) fiber, it is extremely sheer. The first picture mesh is about as opaque as this fabric gets. The second picture shows a more typical size mesh that has decoration.

''Nylon''  is an extremely strong, elastic fiber that has been popular in women’s lingerie for decades. It is very similar in characteristics to silk, but is not nearly as expensive. It is easy to care for and wash, resists stains, and lasts a long time. It's downside is that it's not very absorbent.

:: guideImageLoading [nobr]

<h3>Resource Loading & Custom Images</h3>
<p>Custom resource files allow more manageable downloads while maintaining fast performance in-game that would normally be slowed dramatically due to the delay induced by local image http requests. It also allows players to customize the game by changing images to their own preference. This is accomplished using the AWR Creator tool, which is available to $5+ Patrons.</p>
<p>Navigate to the files using the file selection form button. The awr files are typically located in a folder named AWresources that you downloaded. Select __all__ the relevant awr files. Afterward you have finished selecting the files, you will see the number of files you selected in the file selection form. Click the load button to load the files into the game. Progress will be displayed on a progress bar, and details will be displayed on the screen. After the resources are loaded the game will continue automatically. Loading may take up to 20 seconds due to HTTP request delay with local resources. You can load additional images (or reload them) from the start page by clicking the image status icon.</p>

:: guideLilithPorphyria [nobr]

<h2>Lilith's Porphyria</h2>
<p>Those suffering from this disease are sometimes called a "cumpire", due to the similarity with vampirism and the link to porphyria or blood deficiency. It is a potentially deadly illness that resulted from an institute accident. Sufferers essentially need to consume the sexual fluids of other--primarily semen--in order to survive, unless they are able to take very expensive supplement injections.</p>
<h3>The disease, as described by Lily:</h3>
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you have a pretty serious disease. It's called Lilith's Porphyria, and to the best of my knowledge it's something that has only ever appeared in Appletree, and that was because of an accident. There was a LARP group that was playing in the wrong area at the wrong time... Anyway, that makes it particularly surprising for you to have it. To be honest, I'm not even sure how it's possible.
<br><br>
The disease can be quite serious, and interferes with the normal production of heme molecules by the mitochondria during the growth of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Without properly-formed heme, it's impossible to make properly functioning hemoglobin. Most hemoglobin problems, like sickle cell, are the result of malformed globin molecules. You're making an odd kind of globin-soup that's mostly ineffective at the job of transporting oxygen. To be clear, without proper heme you ''will'' die.
<br><br>
Fortunately, mammalian red blood cells don't have nucleuses, and the residual RNA is gone as well, so your existing blood wasn't affected by the rejuvenator. Unfortunately, you're not producing functional red blood cells to replace the ones that die naturally. You're likely already quite anemic at this point, in fact.
<br><br>
The big problem here is that the condition is limited to a handful of people, all of who are registered with the Institute medical department. You'd probably be under a lot of scrutiny if you suddenly showed up with this brand-new super-rare disease. The good news is that there are a few ways to treat it. The first and most dramatic, are complete blood transfusions. This is what they used on the LARPers until they figured it out a safer treatment.
<br><br>
The ancient treatment for porphyria--drinking blood--is slightly effective, and also why that disease is associated with vampirism. Unfortunately, the liver's recycling system can't be used effectively to break down non-human hemoglobin and allow use of intact heme. Unlike normal porphyria--which isn't fatal--drinking human blood doesn't supply nearly enough heme to keep you alive. At most, it'll delay your need for treatment as a supplement of sorts.
<br><br>
It was discovered, thanks to a rather unseemly coincidence, that prostatic acid phosphatase, called PSA, combined with some other phosphodiesterase isozymes, provides the correct environment for heme synthesis in individuals with Lilith's porphyria, and treats the condition. It's been found that PSA levels were altered in several disorders of the bone marrow, so I suppose it isn't much of surprise...
<br><br>
PSA isn't produced for any medications, so it has to be specially synthesized. Then a PDE5 inhibitor like Avanafil is added, and because it's only approved to treat erectile dysfunction, it's expensive too. The result is is intramuscular injection you need once a week that costs a ridiculous amount of money on top of being uncomfortable. I secured a dose by calling in a favor, but you'll need to go on the Institute's register if you want to be able to buy a regular dose each week...
<br><br>
Which leads to the other option, and the reason why this people with this disease got the nickname "Cumpire". PSA is produced plentifully by the prostate, and consuming enough semen will treat the disease without the expensive shots. You could even drink femcum, as PSA is contained plentifully in that as well, though you'd need to find a squirter to get a large enough dose. As long as you consume an average of one 5ml or larger cumshot per day, you'll be able to avoid needing treatment, though you'll probably need to drink a good deal more to avoid anemia and feel healthy.

:: guideSlateDevice [nobr]

<h2>Slates: Large-Format Tablets</h2>
<p>As the technology of electronics continued to advance in the 21st century, the design and niches of consumer electronics experienced several shifts. The relatively-light weight and increased performance of portable electronics allowed for the introduction of tablet devices. Being ultra-portable but with a larger screen, they began to fill a new niche in consumer electronics. Performance and capability limitations that initially limited the market were soon surpassed with the addition of tablet pcs, which had the ability to easily perform most of the functions that had previously been limited.</p>
<p>With material science improvements leading to lighter and higher-performance batteries, stronger and thinner displays, and the steady improvement of electrical efficiency, the slate pc was born. While still very thin and light--weighing no more than early tablets--these devices boasted far-larger displays. A compact slate may have an <<unit 18 in>> (diagonal) display, while sizes ranging from <<unit 22 in>> to <<unit 26 in>> are more common. It merged the advantage of having a larger laptop or television screen, with the portability of a tablet. While they certainly don't replace small ultra-portable single-hand devices like cell phones, they've caused a dramatic shift in the portable computing market.</p>

:: guideHipsButt [nobr]

<h2>Hips and Butt Guide</h2>
[img[IMG-HipButtShape]]
<br>
The overall shape of the hips and butt can be described by the underlying bone structure. Much of the detail depends on the form and bulk of muscle as well as the distribution of adipose (fat) tissue. Whether the trochanter of the femur and the iliac crest are connected by a smooth curve, or appear to be two curves, are an example of these minor differences, though the overall form is still determined by the underlying bones. Similarly, the shape the ass takes is greatly dependent on these bones.
<br><br>
<dl class="heads">
<dt>Square:</dt>
<dd> has a more spread-out appearance, with the lower outline in a flatter curve. The ass on the square shape in profile curves to a flatter plateau due to its breadth.</dd>
<dt>Cicle:</dt>
<dd> has a narrower and more projected shape, extending a good deal from the body. When looking from above, the globes of the ass have a tendency to look as if they are sitting atop of the body, rather than forming a smooth curve outward from the hips. While the thigh gap on the circle shape is smaller than Square or Heart, the more protruding butt cheeks makes it more visible than on the Square shape.</dd>
<dt>Heart:</dt>
<dd> The heart-shape is thus called because of the heart-like shape of the ass on this structure. It is similar to the square shape except that the anterior pelvic girdle is more open. The wide span of the pubic bones results in a more pronounced gap between the thighs, this separates the globes of the ass, forming the inner point of the heart shape. In vertical profile this shape has a smooth curve from the edge of the hips, unlike the circle shape.</dd>
<dt>Triangle:</dt>
<dd> Has a more UU-shaped ass, with the lower curves being the most straight or horizontal of the bunch. Generally this shape has a more masculine appearance, the main difference being that the iliac crest width is too wide for a man. In more pleasant terms, this shape could be described as athletic, and is more common on certain female athletes like runners, where narrow hips give an advantage.</dd>

<h2>Real Estate Guide</h2>
<p class="print white">
Your choice of apartment affects more than just what the map looks like. While you aren't stuck with a specific apartment throughout the game, you can't change apartments like you would change clothes. This means you should give a little thought to your choice in apartment beyond just looking at the rent. Generally, you'll only be able to change apartments after having lived in your current apartment for at least a month. Any time you rent an apartment, you're going to have to pay a month's rent up front as a deposit. Retrieving the deposit will be determined by how well you've taken care of the apartment you're vacating. The amount of stuff you own will determine amount of time and money a move costs.</p>
<p class="print white">
Rent and certain other expenses will be deducted from your paycheck automatically each week. This ''can'' result in your credit account going into arrears, and owing interest to the bank. The week summary will show you your financial information for the week. There are a few different personality factors that determine how your character reacts to your apartment. Being materialistic, for example, will increase your dissatisfaction with low quality housing, but increase the satisfaction you gain from luxurious housing.</p>
<p class="print white">
There are a few different attributes that each potential home has, including the homes of any romantic partners you stay with. As with real life, choosing a home often involves tradeoffs between different items as well as price. The "perfect place" is usually more expensive than you'd expect, because of the rarity of having everything in a single home.</p>
<dl class="print white">
<dt class="head3">Tier</dt>
<dd>Rather than representing quality, tier is just a short way of describing the size of the home. Even though you only need one bedroom as an individual person, having extra will allow for some "extra room" uses as well as causing the overall home to feel more spacious to your character.
  <ol>
    <li>A studio apartment, without a dedicated bedroom.</li>
    <li>A one-bedroom apartment suitable for a single person.</li>
    <li>A two-bedroom apartment, usually with at least 1.5 baths.</li>
    <li>A three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment.</li>
    <li>A three-bedroom, 2.5 bathroom townhome. More spacious and private than an apartment.</li>
  </ol>
</dd>
<dt class="head3">Finish</dt>
<dd>The relative luxury of a home. Two separate apartments can have identical floorplans and even be in the same building, but still be quite different on the inside. Consider the difference between granite countertops and particle board, or real tile and laminate.
</dd>
<dt class="head3">Upkeep</dt>
<dd>How well the unit has been cared for, or how recently it has been renovated. A home with a high score in upkeep has been better-maintained, and is generally nicer to live in. A home with a low score has a lot of wear and tear, and things like stained carpets and busted hinges are the norm. Things are also more likely to break down and need repair.
</dd>
<dt class="head3">Neighborhood</dt>
<dd>A representation of a few factors affecting the quality of the immediate environment. How loud or obnoxious the neighbors are, and how nice the local amenities are, both contribute to this score. A less obvious factor is the criminal element in the area, though no area in Appletree is anywhere close to being "crime ridden".
</dd>
<dt class="head3">Location</dt>
<dd>The convenience of the location for travel purposes, and probably the most straight-forward home attribute. The lower the score, the longer it will take to get to work, head downtown, or generally just leave your immediate residential area. While the effect is small for a single trip, it does add up.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="print white">A romantic partner's place also has an effect on your character, mitigated by whether or not you are officially "living together". You can receive the benefits of a romantic partner's very nice home for yourself, but won't feel truly at home unless living together. Likewise, if your partner has a really crappy place, staying there will have a negative effect on you.</p>


:: guideMapColors [nobr]

<h2>Map Colors</h2>
<p>When navigating around the game world using the navigation maps, you will probably notice that some map areas are highlighted with different colors on mouseover, and others are just highlighted. The colors have different meanings to help quickly distinguish between areas on a map.</p>
<dl>
<dt class="head3">Colorless:</dt>
<dd>This is a normal map location inside the current map zone. Most map zones will be colorless.</dd>
<dt class="head3">Red:</dt>
<dd>This is an exit location on the map. It indicates that you can leave the current map zone from the location. The Bullseye parking lot is highlighted red because you're able to get into your car and leave from the map zone from that location.</dd>
<dt class="head3">Blue:</dt>
<dd>This color indicates a control or menu. Often, the area doesn't correspond to an actual location you can visit. An example is the area labeled "quick clean" in the player's home. While it is located on the map over the laundry/storage area, it isn't an actual visitable location. Instead it has your character do household chores/cleaning with a single click. Other examples open menus, or may be a location with special options available inside.</dd>
<dt class="head3">Green:</dt>
<dd>Green means go. More specifically, it indicates that the area contains more than one location or has a sub-map. An example is the downtown map zone, which has the Applewood mall location. Inside the mall is a sub-map, which has multiple locations of its own.</dd>

:: guideHomeInventory

<h2>Home Inventory</h2>
<p>
<b>Your home inventory is different from your main inventory.</b> Rather than small useable and consumeable items, the home inventory represents larger items such as furniture and appliances that are typically left in the same place. The home inventory allows you to arrange your home the way you wish, from furniture to decor items. Interior design items such as wall color and other cosmetic choices are also found in the home control menu, but are not part of the home inventory. (Note: Interior design is not yet implemented, and is presently low priority.)
</p>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>
To position items in your home, click and drag it to the drag zone for the location you want it. (press the left mouse button over the item, hold the button down, and move the mouse to drag. Release the mouse button to 'let go' of the item.) Items will snap into place and rearrange themselves automatically, so you do not need to be precise when doing this. The order of items in a drag zone is unimportant.
<br><b>Important Notes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Drag zones can contain more items than are able to fit in the visible area. Scroll with your mouse wheel over a drag zone to see other items, or use the scroll bar inside the drag zone.</li>
  <li>You may not be able to drop an item into certain drag zones. There are a few reasons why this may be the case:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Not all items belong in all locations, you can't place a sofa in your bathroom.</li>
      <li>The location is already full of items, and new items can't be added until one or more items are removed.</li>
      <li>The location doesn't exist, such as a second bedroom in a one-bedroom house. These drag zones are transparent to indicate this.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>In the case of certain items conflicts, the game may allow you to drop an item into a drop zone with a conflicting item. In this case, the item will be returned to your inventory automatically when the conflict is detected. Your item hasn't disappeared!</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>About Home Items</h3>
<p>
Home items provide a unique way of customizing your home, and also provide a way of adding unique actions, content, and gameplay bonuses to your home. They can be bought at various stores around Appletree, or even be aquired in other less-obvious ways.
</p>
<p>
Quality: Each home item has an associated quality value. Values usually range from 1 to 5, but other values are possible for certain items. Broken or awful items have a quality of 0, while a quality of 6 would represent something astoundingly beautiful or rare. Quality has a somewhat different meaning depending on the type of item. For decor, quality is more about aesthetic beauty. For something like an exercise device, quality relates more to how effective the machine is.
</p>
<p>
The number of items that can be placed in each room is limited. This can be thought of as the "space" a room has, or the most items that can be put into the room without looking hideous. The higher the tier of your home, the more space each room will have available for items. Because items can allow special actions and/or have beneficial effects, having space for more items is usually a good thing. Some items may simply make gameplay more convenient. The maximum number of items that can be placed in a room are listed next to the label for the drop zone in brackets. (ex: "Sex Dungeon [5]" can have 5 items placed in it.)
</p>
<p>
Home Items are broken into different categories based on the type of item they are. While categories generally describe the item's purpose, items aren't limited in what they can do based on category. For example: an exercise device could serve as furniture. A workout bench may be useable for having seated, chair-based sex, despite not being furniture!
<dl>
  <dt>furniture:</dt>
  <dd>A common type of item, usually larger in size. Couches, beds, and desks are all examples.</dd>
  <dt>exercise:</dt>
  <dd>A device typically used for exercise, training a certain physical aspect such as endurance, strength, and dexterity, or to practice a particular skill.</dd>
  <dt>electronic:</dt>
  <dd>Rather than specifically referring to something with electronic circuits, the electronic category typically refer to items with more complex functions and purposes. These items may have their own page, taking you away from the game map, or may just have a lot of readable content connected to them.</dd>
  <dt>decor:</dt>
  <dd>These items serve primarily as decorations to improve the look of your home, and therefore, how much you enjoy being there. <i>Quality is especially important for decor items!</i></dd>
  <dt>health:</dt>
  <dd>These items generally relate to your character's physical or mental wellbeing in one way or another, often for a very specific function. An example would be a medical device to help with multiple pregnancy. These items are not very common.</dd>
  <dt>appliance:</dt>
  <dd>An appliance is an item that exists specifically to have a certain effect or to allow certain actions. Examples include: a coffee maker, a spy camera, a cum-spenser. <i>(the last is a 'beverage' dispenser)</i></dd>
  <dt>other:</dt>
  <dd>These are items that don't fit specifically into another category, such as a sex machine.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
Home items can have effects on your character beyond the general impact of quality on your home's appearance. Items with special effects generally don't tell you what their effect is directly, it is up to you to determine what effect an item may have based on it's description and common sense. Items can enable other actions, choices, or events based on their presence, even though they may not have a specific action button associated with them. An easy example is furniture, which enables a wider variety of sex positions in that room. A less obvious example is an item that reduces the time needed to clean. Effects from different items stack, though you can only gain the effect from a specific item (item with the same name) once, even if you have one in each room of your house. Finally, some items may have an effect simply by being in your inventory, and don't need to be placed in a specific location in your home. These items are the exception, and will tell you in their description.

<h3>Jewelry Information</h3>
<p><span class="com">[Incomplete Entry]</span><br>
Jewelry in Accidental Woman is for fashion purposes, and can affect your attractiveness and appearance to a small degree. There are numerous slots in which you can wear jewelry, and unlike clothing or makeup, jewelry generally stays equipped and doesn't require the player to put it on each day. <i>Functional items such as vibrators, collars, and the like are considered accessories, and are handled in the wardrobe along with clothing.</i>
</p>
<p>
You can purchase multiple copies of the same item, to be worn in different slots. For example, you could purchase 2 copies of the same bracelet to be worn on each wrist, or several of the same ring to be worn on different fingers. Wearing jewelry in some slots requires getting pierced first.</p>

<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p>
Known through all written human history, ethanol-based beverages were most of the time considered a "legal" drug. The effects of the alcohol are well-known, the most important being the feeling of mild euphoria. Side-effects are pretty common, especially in cases of overdose.The main mechanic connected to consuming alcohol is loosing control over your character behavior, which can result in various consequences in dialogues with NPCs. The second important part is possibility to get to the dangerous level of alcohol poisoning which can eventually lead your character to morbid complications. The strength of alcohol side-effects is heavily affected by your character body stats, in example more obese character can drink more than slim one.

<p>
Alcoholism is one of the most popular drug addiction among human beings so your character can get addicted to booze too. Having a withdrawal will result in pretty nasty long-lasting effects, such as memory loss, obsessive conditions, nausea and temporary traits change. Having this conditions means that your character basically has so-called "third stage of alcoholism" when ethanol becomes the part of metabolism and person's body need some intake to maintain the well-being. In real world you need years of drinking to get to this stage but for gameplay reasons (or maybe the booze being more potent in future?) you can get to the serious addiction level pretty fast.

There is obviously no need to explain how to cure sex addiction, right?
</p>


:: GuideWithdrawal [nobr]

<h3>Withdrawal</h3>
<p>
Withdrawal is a serious condition caused by lack of the chemicals which your body grew accustomed to. In this game withdrawal refers more to physical aspects of the abstinence while mental craving is a bit different topic. Your character can feel a serious craving to the drug while still not experiencing the true physical effects or vice versa. 
</p>
<p>
The list of effects depends on the drug you are lacking but generally includes health issues, nausea, psychotic episodes, memory loss and much more.

:: guideDates [nobr]

<h3>Dates</h3>
<p>
Dating is a special activity involving one special someone and you having some grown-up romantic fun like eating/drinking together and doing other fun things. In AW, dates can be scheduled with any NPC you are interested in, and also if your relationship with some NPC progress, they can ask you out too. When you schedule the date you get a reminder on your phone and in calendar so you won't miss the event. One hour prior you get the notification and this is a right time to head to the place where your date was set. You can use action button in the top part of the screen or just manually get to the location. Then when your date arrives you can meet them using another action button and the scenario starts.
</p>
<p>
The main stats of the date is the date quality, NPC enjoyment and NPC arousal. Enjoyment is not equal arousal and while you certainly want NPC to enjoy the time they spent with you, you can try to focus on arousal part if you want to go to the bed alone tonight. Your behavior and clothes affects this stat a lot. Date quality refers more to the "luxury" of the evening, taking NPC to the fancy restaurant will make date more cool than eating in some cheap fast food. Some random events can affect this stats too for better or for worse.
</p>
<p>
Successful date effects includes change of NPC's affection to you both as a friend and as a lover and your character happiness and companionship growing not to mention she can get pretty aroused too!
</p>
<p>
While dating you can propose any place from the list for a destination and NPC AI (AWAI) will decide how does they like it. You should consider NPC personality when choosing the place because as well as your character, others can be crude or picky, enjoy crowds or be shy and introverted and so on. So the more you know about the person the better you can fit their taste. 
</p>
<p>
At every place you visit you can do a bunch of things - for food places you can drink and eat, do some dancing in the nightclubs and such. While you can't go to two restaurants one after another you can propose to visit some dessert place if you wish. Also this is a best opportunity to know your partner better - you can always ask them about their life. This will not only reveal some parts of their life story which is unique for every singe NPC created in each gameplay but also this gives you a better understanding of NPC stats as it opens more info in the "Character view" when you click them.
</p>
<p>
At any time you can finish the date in various ways, starting from just kissing your date's cheek and waving them good night to asking them for some hot action. In case the date goes really bad or NPC feels bored they can end the date themselves so you better act the best and show yourself from the best side including clothes, make-up, haircut and whatnot.

:: guideHangouts [nobr]

<h3>Hangouts</h3>
<p>
Basically, hangouts are similar to the <<link "dates">><<replace "#guideText">><<include [[guideDates]]>><</replace>><<scrolltop "#guideText">><</link>> romantic component apart. The result of the successful hangout should be your "like" stats with NPC growing. It also affects your companionship and happiness because everybody likes to spend time with their friends, right? Of course the hangout can't end in some hot action but that's not the main purpose of the event, if you want to try your seduction skill on this pretty NPC you should call them for a date instead.
</p>
<p>
The list of possible activities for the hangouts is different, focusing more on not that formal time spending. While hanging out you can know your friends better, improve your relationship and generally have a good time. The more people from your contact list vare about your character the faster they will grow lonely without you, resulting in calling you for a nice time-wasting together. Of course, you can always ask them out yourself too.
