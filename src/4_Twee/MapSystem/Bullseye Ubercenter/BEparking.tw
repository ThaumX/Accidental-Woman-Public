	@@.head3;A@@s you walk through the Bullseye parking lot, motion in the corner of your eye catches your attention. Curious, you turn and head toward the motion to get a better look. It seems like someone is struggling in their car, so you decide to approach just in case. When you get closer, however, you see that the vigorous motion is likely a struggle of passion. A younger man is apparently jacking off in (hopefully) his car. He's watching his phone, and hasn't seemed to notice you. Pretty bold for such a public place<<if â†‚.pc.kink.exhibition>>, he should pay more attention to his surroundings to avoid getting caught.<<else>>.<</if>></span>

<<else>>
	@@.head3;A@@fter letting your car park, you climb out and start the long walk toward the entrance to Bullseye. You see other cars circling around looking for a spot close to the entrance, hoping someone will leave. You'll be inside long before they are.
