<<set $helpText = "''Premade characters'' are basically different player characters that are already set up. Some of them will have attributes or setups that aren't entirely possible in character creation. When you select a premade character, you skill character creation and go straight to the first night after your transformation.<br><br>''Roleplay Challenges'' are premade characters that also have a few additional rules during gameplay to make it more challenging or unique. Like premade characters, roleplay challenges skip character creation.">>@@.head1;Premade Characters@@<br><br>
Premade characters are characters that have been set up for different experiences and ''roleplay challenges''. When you select a premade character below, all your choices for character creation will be skipped (including NPC options), and set on the character you chose. The only options you will be able to set are your name and (if enabled and available) cheats. Even though cheats are available for backers, using cheats can reduce or eliminate roleplaying challenge, and may defeat the point of some of the premade characters below. Selecting a premade character will skip the prologue and character creation, so ''if this is your first time playing you should probably start off with a normal game''.
