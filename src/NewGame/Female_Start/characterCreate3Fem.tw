<td width="20%"><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.risky" false true>> <<link "Likes Bare Sex">><<replace "#sex">>''Bare Sex:'' You really enjoy bare and/or risky sex, and like the feeling of receiving a creampie. You will find sex that ends in a creampie (whether accidental or intentional) to be more fullfilling. This doesn't include an urge to get pregnant, just a certain amount of risk, and you'll still want partners to pull out or use condom on risky days. This will not remove your worry about potential pregnancy or disease if applicable.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td width="20%"><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.cumSlut" false true>> <<link "Cumslut">><<replace "#sex">>''Cumslut:'' More than simply liking oral sex, you have a strong like of semen.

You tend to find larger balls more attractive.<</replace>><</link>></td>

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.pregnancy" false true>> <<link "Pregnancy Fetish">><<replace "#sex">>''Pregnancy:'' You are strongly aroused by pregnancy and the concept of breeding. Unlike simply liking bare sex, you are far more likely to seek and engage in pregnancy-risk sex, and if the two are combined may even be willing to circumvent your partner's attempts at birth control to enjoy risky sex. You do not suffer worry about potential pregnancy, but can still become worried about disease if applicable. You tend to find large testicles more attractive.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.sizequeen" false true>> <<link "Size Queen">><<replace "#sex">>''Size Queen:'' You have an obsession with large cocks, finding them much more attractive than normal, and have a dislike of average to small cocks.

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.dom" false true>> <<link "Dominant Streak">><<replace "#sex">>''Dominant Streak:'' You have a natural preference or aptitude for being dominant. This doesn't instantly make you a masterful dom as soon as you find a sub partner though.<</replace>><</link>></td>

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.force" false true checked>> <<link "Forced Okay">><<replace "#sex">>''Forced:'' The most popular female fantasy based on empirical research, and the subject of most novels of the romance genre, forced is when you are forced into a sexual situation ranging from a kiss to full intercourse. Unchecking this box indicates that you are completely opposed to any forced situations, even with a loving partner and/or via roleplay.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.exhibition" false true>> <<link "Exhibitionist">><<replace "#sex">>''Exhibitionist:'' You enjoy the thrill of exhibitionism, and are more willing to wear revealing clothes in public.

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.buttSlut" false true>> <<link "Buttslut">><<replace "#sex">>''Buttslut:'' A more extreme version of likes anal, you really enjoy anal sex. You recieve significantly more satisfaction from anal, but will be unhappy with a partner that isn't willing to have anal frequently enough.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.bond" false true>> <<link "Bondage Okay">><<replace "#sex">>''Bondage:'' You find bondage activity enjoyable, or are at least willing to participate. This acts as a 'soft gate' to bondage content. Not checking this box won't eliminate content with light or minor bondage, but will avoid more intense bondage play. <</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.rape" false true>> <<link "Rape Fetish">><<replace "#sex">>''Rape Fetish:'' You have strong fantasies about hardcore rape. Sexual assault and rape is unlikely to harm you much mentally, but you are also more likely to encounter such situations due to risky behavior tied to this fetish.<</replace>><</link>></td>

You get a lot more satisfaction than normal from sex in public. You also find it difficult to resist temptation in a public setting.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.liberate" false true>> <<link "Liberated">><<replace "#sex">>''Liberated:'' You realize that sex doesn't have to be connected to love and relationships, and find satisfaction in casual sex. This also means that you don't have any problem with prostitution, and you tend to enjoy the activity more. Your prostitution skill will increase more rapidly, though your attitutes may be a turn off to some NPCs of a romantic persuasion.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.masochist" false true>> <<link "Masochist">><<replace "#sex">>''Masochist:'' You enjoy pain, and find it sexually arousing. At this time, this doesnt' do much. <i>If more content is desirable it can be added, but it's a little outside my ability to write effectively.

You get a ''lot'' more satisfaction from extreme sex and activities like orgies and gloryholes, and have no problem with prostitution. You start high on the 'sex addiction' stat and gain it quicker, but also suffer less from humiliation and other negative social input. You can cure a bad day at the office easily, if you can avoid nymphomania. ''Warning--Choosing this trait automatically enables some other "okay" traits! (oral, anal, force, bondage, exhibition)'' <i>Characters who follow the path of sexual hedonism will eventually find this trait added later, and eventually the 'Superslut' trait.

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.fap" false true>> <<link "Fapper">><<replace "#sex">>''Fapper:'' You really enjoy a good fap, and get a little more satisfaction from it. Your expert touch has made normal encounters less pleasurable, and you find normal sex less satisfying.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.kink.shame" false true>> <<link "Shamefast">><<replace "#sex">>''Shamefast:'' For whatever reason, you find sexual activities to be shameful or wrong. You never really let yourself enjoy it, so sexual activities of all kinds are less satisfying.

<td width=25%><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.acid" false true >> <<link "Vaginal Enzymes">><<replace "#mutes">>''Vaginal Enzymes:'' Your Bartholin glands (two large-pea-sized glands that produce vaginal lubrication) secrete an extra enzyme called Rubber Oxygenase (RoxA) that allows cleavage and oxygenation of several rubber polymers including latex. Exposure to this enzyme rapidly degrades the structural integrity of condoms. The longer a condom is exposed to your lubrication (including pre-intercourse activities), the greater the likelyhood that it will shred during intercourse or break upon ejaculation. <i>This mutation significatly affects condom effectiveness, but in a manageable way. Sex that finishes quickly without female orgasm has only a small chance of breakage, while long-duration sex will almost certainly result in the condom shredding.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td width=25%><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.birthCon" false true >> <<link "Abnormal Hormones">><<replace "#mutes">>''Abnormal Hormones:'' Your endocrine system is unusual, particularly in regard to gonadotropins, resulting in less effective chemical birth control. Birth control pills, patches, and implants have a much greater chance of being ineffective each cycle. <i>Increases odds from 2-4% to 15-30% depending on method.

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.cycle" false true >> <<link "Hyper Ovulatory Phase">><<replace "#mutes">>''Hyper Ovulatory Phase:'' Your menstral cycle is tuned for fertility. You have an extended ovulatory phase during your menstral cycle that causes you to ovulate multiple times after your first ovulation. This causes your period to be especially brief, your highly-fertile period is greatly expanded, and you are more fertile than normal during the other portions of your cycle. <i>Combining this with Multiple Ovulation could result in some [[interesting|http://i.imgur.com/wD8sPmx.jpg]] results.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.twinWomb" false true >> <<link "Twin Wombs">><<replace "#mutes">>''Twin Wombs:'' You have two fully-formed and functional wombs, complete with two cervixes and two sets of ovaries. Your second womb is in the reversed anterior position. This allows you to have two pregnancies at once. <i>For right now, the second womb only becomes viable once the first is already pregnant. This could be changed depending on feedback.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.phero" false true >> <<link "Vulva Pheromones">><<replace "#mutes">>''Vulva Pheromones:'' You secrete pheromones from your vulva that puts men into an animalistic rut. Men who have been exposed are unlikely to take no for an answer, even if they are normally considerate and respectful. This also includes considerations such as wearing a condom or pulling out. You will have to protect your groin until you are ready for sex.<</replace>><</link>></td>

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.mouth" false true >> <<link "Salivary Enzymes">><<replace "#mutes">>''Salivary Enzymes:'' The salivary glands in your mouth secrete an extra enzyme called Rubber Oxygenase (RoxA) that allows cleavage and oxygenation of several rubber polymers including latex. Exposure to this enzyme rapidly degrades the structural integrity of condoms. The longer a condom is exposed to your mouth, the greater the likelyhood that it will fail.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.contort" false true >> <<link "Contortionist">><<replace "#mutes">>''Contortionist:'' You must have had circus performers in your ancestry. You're able to get yourself into slightly kinkier sex positions, and you suffer far fewer health consequences from long-term or extreme bondage. There may also be a few obscure situations where you could benefit from your increased flexibility.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.litePhero" false true>> <<link "Alluring Pheromones">><<replace "#mutes">>''Alluring Pheromones:'' A throwback to animal ancestors, you naturally produce pheromones in your sweat glands.

Stretching is broken into two categories: temporary and permanent. Temporary stretching results from relatively normal activities, and is reduced over time with a doubling counter. Extreme activities can result in permanent stretching, and a large buildup of temporary stretching has a chance for some to become permanent. Permanent stretching never recovers except with the Elastic Orifices mutation.

<td><<checkboxB "$PC.mutate.pseudoPreg" false true>> <<link "Pseudo-Pregnancy">><<replace "#mutes">>''Pseudo-Pregnancy:'' Your body has a strange reaction to <i>unusual</i> genetic material.
