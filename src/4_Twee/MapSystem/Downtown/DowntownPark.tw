@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing on one of the several paths winding through the Samuel Steele Memorial Park. From here, you can still catch glimpses of the buildings outside the park, but in some areas the trees and bushes are quite thick, allowing for a better appreciation of nature. There are several benches where you can sit and relax, and several gravel trails leading to small isolated area that dot the northern area of the park.

<<f y>>ou take a walk on a random path into one of the park's thickets of trees. You stumble into a tiny meadow surrounded by trees. In the middle you see a couple that has laid down a blanket in the tall grass. Of course, they're having sex, but this couple's fucking seems to be more thorough and deliberate than you'd expect to find in the woods. You retrace your steps down the small foot trail that led here in order to avoid disturbing them.
