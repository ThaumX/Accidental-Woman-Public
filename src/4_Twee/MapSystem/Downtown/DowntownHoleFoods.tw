@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing outside of Hole Foods Marketplace, a high-end grocery store that isn't part of a major grocery store chain, at least not one that you've ever heard of. The store seems to really focus on the idea that life is better with a more natural lifestyle, including the food you eat. Whatever the reason, it's certainly much nicer than Bullseye's grocery department, with a better selection too.
