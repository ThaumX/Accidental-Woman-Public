@@.head3;Y@@ou open the washing machine and load your stuff. After pushing a couple of buttons it starts and you sit on top of it waiting for the laundry to be finished. It doesn't take long - modern clothes washers are far more faster than their 20-century predecessors, the full cycle including drying takes only about 30 minutes.<br>

It was doable, though perhaps right at the edge of what you'd be comfortable doing yourself. The most surprising thing is that while the unit is mostly automatic, the most detailed tests require the use of a vaginal probe. Thankfully it comes with a long metal cable, which makes it easier to clean, though you won't be able to hide it from guests.<</dialog>><</button>>
