<<f c>>urious what the next step is in repairing the rejuvenator after the inspection is finished, you walk over to Lily who is <<switch _labLily>><<case 1 2 3 4 5 8>>sitting at the electronics workstation.<<case 6>>is walking around the lab.<<case 7 10>>sitting at the desk in the middle of the room.<<case 9>>standing in front of a whiteboard covered in scribbles.<</switch>> @@.pc;Hey Lils, you got a minute?@@
</p>
<p>
She looks up from her work, a little annoyed at being interrupted. @@.npc;Yeah, sure. What's up?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Well, I just wanted to see what we're going to be working on next.@@ You shrug. @@.pc;Like, what's the next step to fix the rejuvenator?@@
</p>
<p>
Lily ponders for a moment. @@.npc;Honestly <<name>>, it's really hard to say at this point... I suppose no matter how the electronics and other components turn out, we'll probably need to rebuild a couple of the electromagnets.@@
</p>
<p>
You aren't really sure what that might entail though. @@.pc;Okay, thanks Lily.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;No problem@@ she says, as she returns to her work.
