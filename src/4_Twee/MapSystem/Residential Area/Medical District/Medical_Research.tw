<p>
<<f y>>ou enter the Nekomatics Cumming-Soon store to see what sort of products are available that are still in development. The "store" is little more than a small office with a few waiting chairs and some Nekomatics branding on the walls. There aren't actually any products on display, but given the nature of the business, that doesn't seem odd.
</p>
<p>
A woman wearing a lab coat enters the room from a door opposite the entrance. You can't help but notice a pair of pointy cat ears poking out from her tawny auburn hair. @@.npc;Sorry for the wait... how can I help you today?@@ She walks over to what you presume is the sales counter. As she does, you catch sight of an auburn-furred tail following behind her.
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Umm, I was curious what sort of products you had on early release.@@
</p>
<p>
The woman picks up a slate from the counter and turns it on. @@.npc;Right now all we have available are three products from our new line of gene tonics.@@ She makes a few taps and gestures on the screen. @@.npc;Have you purchased any treatments from our Cumming-Soon store before?@@
</p>
<p>
You shake your head. @@.npc;No, this is my first time.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Okay, that's fine. I'm just obligated to inform you that the treatments on offer have not been officially released yet, and that they haven't been officially confirmed as safe by any regulatory agency. Purchasing a treatment requires signing some paperwork. The major points are that you won't be able to sue Nekomatics should you have problems with the treatments and that you are obligated to report any side effects experienced within 30 days of purchase. If you don't report the side effects, you'll have to pay the remainder of the normal retail price.@@ She takes a breath and pushes the slate towards you. @@.npc;Whew! Now that that's out of the way, here's what we have on offer.@@
