@@.head3;T@@he surrounding area consists mostly of a mowed lawn, with two large soccer goals. You can make out some faded paint on the grass marking out a reduced-size soccer field. Unlike the basketball court to the southeast, there isn't any seating. The trees on either side of the area make it seem surprisingly isolated. <<comment "Yes. I am aware that most of the world uses the word football as slang for association football or soccer. No, it's not called football because you use your foot to kick the ball. It's called football because you run with the ball on foot, as opposed to on horseback. Peasants in the 12th century and onward were unable to use horses for those traditional games, and football was born. In football, the ball touching the ground or being kicked is generally prohibited outside of certain circumstances. Kickball, however, is a game that was eventually adapted to become association football.">></p>
