@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing in the Pump & Dump Guns and Pawn store. It's quite a bit different on the inside than you'd expect, with a lot of the display area dedicated to fetish gear and sex toys. There are several cases dedicated to firearms though, many of which seem to be used. It's certainly an odd combination, and you hope that the used goods are limited to the guns and doesn't include the store's other merchandise.

The clerk grins. @@.npc;I'll certainly give it my best shot!@@ He steps closer, his long rod poking your belly before he can get close enough for a hug. He reaches his arms out, grabbing you by the hips and pulling you closer; his cock forced upward between you, it still presses firmly against your abdomen. He bends down for a kiss as his hands slide lower to grip your ass cheeks. Just as you were starting to find the insistent pressure of his cock on your belly uncomfortable, he takes a firm hold of your upper thighs and lifts you up. From there he takes a few steps and lays you down on a leather-upholstered bench.

It takes only a few moments more for his cock to be lodged firmly inside you. You sigh in pleasure as his engorged member invades you seemingly without end, inch after inch sliding into your depths. You feel a delightful tingle as his head lifts your cervix before finally pressing against your deepest spot. He keeps pushing for a moment, delightfully stretching you before finally retreating. That's when he truly begins to fuck you, each powerful thrust hitting your depths before retreating in a staccato rhythm. The pleasure you feel is intense, your awareness rapidly narrowing to encompass only the two of you. Instinctively responding to the building pleasure, your insides shift as your womb begins to drop hungrily. The change means little because the clerk's hard cock needs no help reaching your depths, but it does place your cervix directly in the way of the invading member.

<p>
With each thrust the clerk's cockhead scrapes against your G-spot before ramming that sensitive donut of flesh, and the pleasure overwhelms you. It takes only moments before your first orgasm crests over you. You're given no chance to recover, the pleasure continues to wash over you mercilessly. You lose track of time and simply scream out in pleasure as your second and then third orgasms rock you to the core. You're barely aware when the clerk makes one final vicious thrust, his tip shoving against your cervix as if to penetrate even it. It's then that the first of many thick ropes of cum are sprayed into the small space left by the opening of your cervix pressing against his cockhead. Some of the virile cum is forced further into you, and you swear you can feel every drop.

  The Tauran Union Compact Pistol CP38 is a small semi-automatic handgun intended to be easy to carry for self defense or as a backup weapon. The weapon is unique because it has a curved frame, allowing it to be carried more snugly against the hip or leg. The curved handgrip requires that you use the correct hand, and can take a little getting used to.

Because of the extreme lethality of plasma weapons combined with their ability to ignore most types of police body armor, they are expected to be banned in the near future. This has made the E7 very popular due to the 'buy it while you still can' mentality. Despite this popularity, the weapon has several drawbacks: its bulk and weight make single-handed operation impractical, it requires a warmup period before firing the first time, and both the weapon and ammunition are very expensive.<br><br>Ammunition: E7 Cartridge | 10-20 shots | Semi Auto

  Cyka is a Slavic firearms company in North Asia. The Blyat design started as a whale project to create a machine pistol in the United Kingdom. In a rare bout of good decision-making, the UK government decided to give up on designing their own weapons and instead bought from the Germans. The abandoned design was appropriated by Cyka and eventually turned into their signature weapon. They solved the most pressing issues with the design by using lighter ammunition, but it still has a high rate of jams and misfires. Despite the overall poor quality of the design and manufacturing, it has remained popular because it is extremely simple to modify the civilian model to fire in full automatic.<br><br>Ammunition: 22LR | 33 rounds | Automatic

  The Milwaukee Brewery and Firearms Kraft 11 is a civilian version of a weapon originally produced by the now-defunct Wisconsin Armaments Corporation. The original M11 subcompact machine pistol--commonly called the WAC-11--was manufactured in the 1970s and intended for military use. The Kraft 11 is an almost exact copy of the original design, however the fire mode selection mechanism is not included. A knowledgeable individual can manually chance to automatic firing mode by disassembling the weapon, though this is illegal. MBF maintains that nostalgia for 1980s action movies is the largest driver of Kraft 11 sales, and not the potential for automatic fire.<br><br>Ammunition: .38 ACP | 30 rounds | Automatic

  This firearm was most likely obtained illegally from the Institute. Civilian possession is likely illegal due to the presence of a burst fire mode. The weapon seems to fire frangible flechettes at extremely high speed. Little else is known about the weapon. Acquiring new ammunition is likely to be extremely difficult or outright impossible.<br><br>Ammunition: Flechette | 75 | Semi Auto / 4 Round Burst
