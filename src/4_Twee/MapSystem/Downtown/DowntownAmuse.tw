@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing in an area that breaks away from the somewhat standardized appearance of downtown Appletree. There are several larger buildings housing various recreational amusements, and there's also a small theme park called Erotika Land [name undecided]. Basically, it's full of places that are awkward to go to alone.
