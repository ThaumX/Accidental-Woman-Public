<h3>An Individual Birth Control Pill</h3>
One pill out of a 28-pill package.<br>
BasiPill is a no-frills inexpensive oral birth control medication. It contains a mixture of estrogen and progesterone and must be taken daily to remain fully effective. If used as directed it is very effective at preventing pregnancy, with a 90% effective rate over the course of one year. If not used as directed, it is much less effective. Like all birth control pills, this pill may have harmful--potentially fatal--side effects. This pill is known to increase the risk of cancer and cardiovascular events. Do not take this pill if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or work in the dairy industry.
<p>
Take one pill per day, every day. Do not skip a week. If you forget to take a dose, take it immediately unless it is almost time for your next dose, in which case you should skip the missed dose. Do not take more than one dose per day.

<h3>A 4 Liter Cryo-Canister of your Breast Milk</h3>
Specially designed by the Institute for free-range cows and cows on the go, this cryo-canister preserves breast milk until it can be delivered to (or collected by) the Farm COOP. The super-cooled storage can keep the milk fresh for months, and once warmed up tastes like it's fresh from the nipple. Unfortunately these portable canisters have a limited effective period of about a week before needing to be recharged at the COOP's milk facility, so don't try to stockpile your milk! This particular canister was loaned to you along with some others by the Farm COOP. It has a <<switch $date[1]>><<case 1>>yellow<<case 2>>green<<case 3>>blue<<case 4>>purple<</switch>> sticker with your ID number on it.
<p>
Note: you must deliver this to the Farm COOP yourself to be paid. Regular milk pickups and full purchase rates are for registered HuCow members only.

The Probe Response line of tests is targeted at those who don't want to wait nearly 2 weeks to see if they're pregnant.

The early results come at a price, however, as they are noticeably more expensive than standard tests.

Note that this test can only detect pregnancy once a zygote has successfully implanted.

<p>
You take your time and savor the tasty beverage. It tastes pretty much exactly like cum, along with a hint of citrus fruit. The main difference is that somehow the beverage is a lot smoother to drink, with the consistency of heavy cream instead of being somewhat gooey like normal cum. It makes it much easier to drink as a beverage, and before you realize it you manage to finish off the bottle. You somewhat miss the cloying way the flavor sticks in your mouth with real cum, but perhaps the sheer volume of bull's milk makes up for it. @@.mono;Delicious!@@
