If you had to describe the complex in one word, it'd probably be 'corporate'. You've definitely worked in worse places though, the administrative complex is fairly well appointed. Even the employee bathrooms set aside for the average drone are equiped with all sorts of fancy hygiene devices. @@.mono;I guess? I need to figure out how to use all of them...@@ The break rooms are similarly equiped. If the place wasn't so bland and regimented, it'd be amazing.">>

Apparently the odd layout makes sense when considering the different research departments that have operations here. @@.mono;It may make sense to bureaucrats or efficiency experts, but it's a pain in the ass to find your way around.">>

<h2 class="handwriting">Welcome to the T.I.T.S. Employee Enrichment Center!</h2>
<p class="gab">
Thank you for your interest in the Institute's Employee Enrichment center! Unfortunately, our new location conveniently located in the the ClITS facility isn't open just yet. We're hard at work preparing the new Enrichment Center for our Institute Family. In addition to the standard services we've been proud to offer over the last several years, we'll also be offering an expanded range of enrichment and family services. Thanks to our new location in the middle of the ClITS, we'll also be able to offer limited medical services! After all, <i>"A healthy employee is a productive employee"</i>! Keep an eye on your inbox for a memo announcing the grand opening celebration, it'll be great fun for the whole family!
<br><br>
See you then!
