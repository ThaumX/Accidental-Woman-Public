<p>@@.head3;T@@he Muschi Valley Farm Cooperative still needs some descriptive text here!</p>
<p class="yellow">
The Farm Cooperative has not been properly implemented yet, and is here only to sell milk for the time being. You can visit other locations here, but the content is limited. (for now!)
</p>
<p class="handwriting">This area is the primary area for content revolving around becoming a professional HuCow, getting HuCow treatments and even becoming a full-time HuCow as your career. It also will have content related to farming, breeding, vat-grown semen and other products, certain chemical substances (drugs), animals, and other similar items in addition to it's connection to the Institute and Area 69. You can sell your breastmilk here, and also browse the farmer's market.</p>
