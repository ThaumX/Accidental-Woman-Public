<p>@@.pc;Oh, you scared me, mister Langford, good evening.@@</p>
<p>@@.npc;I can assure you I had no such intention, ma'am.@@ He steps closer to you and presents his arm to lead you into the room he emerged from. @@.npc;It is my very good honor to invite you to your first circle meeting, miss <<surname>>.@@</p>
<p>Ewan leads you into a room even more dimly lit than the hallway you arrived in. As your eyes slowly adjust to the room, you find the place. The place looks like an expensive gentlemen's club which you would expect to see in a movie about Victorian London. Around ten people are sitting in comfy chairs and couches, half of them are women, and all of them are overdressed for what should be a simple meeting of a book club. @@.mono;Well, it doesn't look like a book club at all...@@ Ewan leads you to the center of the room and you feel a little bit uneasy while eleven people shamelessly contemplate you.</p>
<p>@@.npc;I am glad to introduce to you, ladies and gentlemen, miss <<name>> <<surname>>, the newest member of our circle.@@ You expect some reaction, maybe clapping or some words from members, but can't see anything apart from a few nods. Feeling more and more awkward you make a vile attempt to break the ice. @@.pc;Umm, hi? Nice to meet you all...@@ Your voice dies out in the dead silence of the room and you feel your back sweating. You feel dizzy for some reason.</p>
<p>@@.npc;Ahem... As a sign of following our good traditions we test our new members.@@ You look back at Ewan. @@.mono;Oh, what have I got myself into?@@ He gestures to the small table with two seats. There is something on the table but you can't say what it is from where you stand. Nerviously gulping, you take a seat at the platen. Ewan looks at the middle-aged women in the high chair. @@.npc;Amelia, would you kindly?@@ She has magnificent make-up and a flawless black dress, though it is a bit vintage. Her skin is very pale and you fight the urge to giggle with a sudden silly thought. @@.mono;Nice, I got into a vampire's lair now... Okay, <<name>>, you are clearly getting hysterical. Just play along...@@</p>	
<p>Amelia's gaze never leaves you as she takes the contents of a small box on the table. It is a deck of cards, but you don't recognize them as standard playing cards. Having no suits, these cards instead depict some foreign looking imagery. With her gaze seeming to peer into your soul, she shuffles the deck before arranging them in a pattern reminiscent of solitaire. Her beautiful hands move fast and you feel charmed with their swift and precise movements. When she finishes there are five cards in front of you. @@.npd;Flip three of them, child.@@ Her voice is deep and guttural; it provokes arousal and makes you think about kissing her sweet plump dark-red lips for a moment.</p>

<<f y>> ou turn three cards and put them closer to youself looking at the pictures. Amelia glances quickly at the cards you have choosen. @@.npd;Ah, of course. Interesting ways you had passed, unusual ways I'd rather say. Not every living person can brag they went through the changes of such power as you did. But I see even more ahead. And that appetency as well... You will be a virtue member of the circle. Stand up, <<name>>.@@	
<p>You obey and realize that other members surrounded you while you was ogling cards and listening to Amelia. Their hands softly touch you; brushing, teasing, palping your flesh. In other situation you would try to stop it but <<has slut>>you have some ideas where it is going now<<or>>your head feels too heavy to resist<</has>>. @@.npe;Welcome to the circle...@@ Somebody behind you puts a soft black narrow scarf over your eyes blindfolding you and the worlds disappears. All is left is their hands brushing over your body and your hard breath. Button by button they remove your clothes and it rustle down to your legs...</p>
<p>... You are floating on the waves while dozens of hands tease your body, squeezing and pinching your nipples, fingers sliding into your<<if setup.sexToys.check("pc", "clit") === true>> pussy and back hole<<else>>back hole<</if>> shamelessly exploring every inch of your body. Each touch feels as a pure bliss; you moan with pleasure and bite your lips until somebody's soft lips covers yours and you almost cum from the sensation. Biting and barely holding your drool you revel the deep french kissing with somebody you don't even see. @@.mono;I... oh... I don't want it to ever end...@@</p>	
<p>Suddenly lips disappear and hands push you down to the ground forcing you to crawl forward on all fours. Mindlessly and happily you obey until your mouth bumps into something warm, moist... and delicious. Through the mist in your head you realize that this time it is completely different set of lips. Those lips bear only females and you start licking the plump wet vulva of a perfect stranger almost drowning in her dampness.</p>	
<center>[img[IMG-PhoenixNestLick]]</center><br>
<p>Licking the clit with your tongue you are sluggishly surprised that you get so much pleasure from giving oral sex. This doesn't matter much to you since the delight is just way too great and her moaning is so loud. You hear rhytmicall squishing sounds around you, moaning coming from all around you and internally submit to your place in this orgy before diving back to the pussy of the girl. @@.npd;Mmm...mmm...ohhmyyyyyYYY!@@ She cums right on your face spraying you with her juice and you can't but collect it with your hand and drink it thirstily.</p>
<p>You push yourself back to her pussy to get more of that deligtful vulva nectar and when somebody's cock enters your <<if setup.sexToys.check("pc", "clit") === true>><<run â†‚.pc.fert.creampie("unknown", 80, "default")>><<eatdrug "cream" 2>><<run â†‚.pc.body.pussy.insert(3)>>own pussy<<else>><<run â†‚.pc.body.asshole.insert(3)>><<run setup.condition.add({loc: "asshole", amt: 4, tgt: "pc", wet: 5, type: "cum"})>>asshole<</if>> you accept it gladly and gratefully. You do your best to continue licking and sucking her lips and clit while the thick hot dick slides in and out of your hole giving you the best ride of your life.</p><<satisfy 25 'Phoenix circle orgy'>><<status 0>> 	
<p>Clenching and shivering girl cums once again and you feel her clit throbbing under your nimble tongue. Her screaming pushes the man behind you over the edge and he finishes deep inside your hole pushing his stiff pulsing cock as far as he can. Domino principle continues to work as it makes you cum too; you moan and beg and pant stuck between them for it seems like an eternity before finally falling from all fours to the soft carpet.</p>
<p>When you regain your consciousness you found that your blindfold went off. There is nobody in the room, your clothes are neatly folded on the chair. @@.mono;Was it... a dream?@@ You wake up and feel that the carpet is still moist which means it all was real. You try to pull on the doorknobs in the room but it seems all of them are closed. @@.pc;Hey? Anybody still here?@@ Dressing up and going down the stairs you wonder if you did a good job and would they invite you again for the next <i>Book club meeting</i>...</p><<run setup.omni.new("phoenixPartyCall")>><<updatebar>><<status 0>>

<<eatdrug "heat" 15>><<f y>>ou go upstairs smelling incense, your feet are drowning in the thick red carpet on the floor.<<if â†‚.pc.status.addict.heat > 80>>@@.mono;Do I smell Heat drug? Hmm...@@<<elseif â†‚.pc.status.addict.heat > 40>>@@.mono;Hmm, this smell reminds me of something...@@<</if>> Getting to the massive wooden door you press on it and enter the main room. Most of the members are already here having a quiet chat so you occupy a free place on the luxurious leather sofa between the formal-dressed man in his 40s and a woman with voluptuous dark red lips. Amelia is sitting on the high chair in the deep corner of the dimly lit room smoking and smiling subtly. She nods you in a solemn and mystique fashion but in this weird place, this doesn't feel too flatulent. The club has this special atmosphere justifying all the oddities and adding a thick layer of importance to everything that happens here. For some reason, it doesn't feel like an ordinary sex club at least not when you are inside. Once you cross the border to this kingdom of lust and languor you find yourself doubting or criticizing anything that happens here.
<p>
While you hesitate while trying to grasp your emotions and feelings about the Phoenix Club its leader stands up and other members cease their talking and turn to her. She feels very confident and bossy without putting any visible effort into it and you feel mesmerized by her prominent figure in the same black dress you saw her last time. She smiles in a sly yet somehow polite and formal fashion before addressing the members.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Ladies and gentlemen, it is my good honor to greet you at our weekly meeting of the Phoenix club. Today is an important day, today the moon is growing and the Mars is as bright as it gets only once a decade. Its lazy dance with Venus hides secret vigor, hidden from the simpletons and we, the bearer of true meanings and connoisseurs of delights shall oblige to this dance altogether. As the writer said, "Thou old melancholy devil, out of thy lament soundeth a lurement: thou resemblest those who with their praise of chastity secretly invite to voluptuousness!" And like those, wandering in the dark in a search of the light we follow the birth of the moon to give our prayers to the fountain of life, crimson and free...@@
</p>
<p>
@@.mono;Oh, we finally talk about books and writers it seems? But who is this writer? I feel illiterate now. She could at least elucidate us on who said that...@@ You feel that you slowly lose the idea of what Amelia is talking about while your head slowly gets dizzy. Still clinging to the speech you can only catch some parts but the overall idea is elusive.
</p>
<p>
After a while, you find yourself just ogling Amelia talking with wide artistic gestures towards her audience. You don't understand a word and just enjoying the sound of her voice. She looks so enigmatic and attractive and you can't stop but imagine touching her perfect pale skin and kneading those plump breasts of her. When she finishes her speech you barely notice her absently <<link "licking your lips">><<scenego "PhoenixClubNext-2">><</link>>.</p>

<center>[img[IMG-PhoenixLips]]</center><br>
<<f i>>t doesn't take long before the main part of the evening begins. Through that mist in your head and blurriness in your eyes, you notice that all around you look different, more desirable. They act sensual and uninhibited now. Some of them stand up and start worshipping Amelia's body while others are making out with each other. Your gaze slowly drifts around the room until it fixates on the women with plump red lips, you can't stop ogling her and she returns your stare with her eyes half-closed and a soft soundless moan. Slowly and sensually, she crawls closer to you, and in a moment you are pressed to the sofa by her weight. She covers your skin with kisses and each one of them feels blissful and ecstatic.
<p>
You release your desire wild and caress her curvy body moaning and squirming underneath her. Still hugging you she presses her knee to your pussy and <<if setup.sexToys.check("pc", "clit") === true>><<else>>despite your clit being inaccessible <</if>>you can't but rub it to her leg while her delicious sweet lips meet with yours. Her thick tongue invades your mouth forcing your mouth open giving you the sloppiest kiss of your life. Drool runs down your cheek as she almost fucks your mouth with her tongue. Each and every inch of your skin feels extra sensitive giving your a pure carnal with even the softest touch. She starts bouncing back and forth slightly which makes you focus your blurry vision once again. After some struggle to regain at least some level of consciousness you barely register that your partner's dress is obscenely yanked to her back and somebody rams her from behind.
</p>
<p>
She comes almost immediately spasming right above you and you feel her orgasm like it was yours. strings of saliva drool down from her agape mouth while she screams in a most obscene fashion thrashing on your body. <<has hard>>Despite it is usually hard for you to orgasm y<<orhas easy>>It doesn't usually take much to make you cum even in a normal situation, so y<<or>>Y<</has>>ou feels that shaking of a knee pressed to your clit is just too overwhelming and succumb to the orgasm yourself more from the arousal than actual stimulation. @@.pc;AaaaahhAHHHHH AHHHH!...@@
</p>
<p>
You can't remember most of the evening. You are standing on the sidewalk not that far from the Phoenix club, your clothes are smeared with various fluids and you feel something gurgling in your pussy with every step. It looks like you can barely remember the last two hours or so. Your memory is filled with pictures of lustful orgy and it is hard to recall specific events of that evening. Your knees are shaking a bit but there is a wide goofy smile on your face you can't remove. @@.mono;Those guys know a thing or two on how to make those club meetings exciting, hehe! I should totally go there next time!@@
