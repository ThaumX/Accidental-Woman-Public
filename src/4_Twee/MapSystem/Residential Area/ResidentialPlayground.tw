In addition to classic playground items like swings and slides, there's also an area with several picnic tables and a half-court for basketball. It seems to be a hangout spot for teenagers. On the far side there's a tiny building housing a boy's and girl's restroom. On the opposite side, there are a few benches for parents to sit and keep an eye on smaller children.
