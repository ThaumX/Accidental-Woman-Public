@@.head3;Y@@ou are at the town's stadium. The big poster above the main entrance announces the next cockmongering match, it seems the Appletree stadium will host a lot of NACA WCC matches this year. You wonder why this new sport has become so popular in favor of the more traditional options such as Basketball and Football. <br>

<<f a>>s you mingle with a small crowd of cockmongering fans, you're surprised to see one of the home team players come out to mingle a bit with the crowd. She's naked, of course, and escorted by a stadium security guard. The people are really respectful, however, so it doesn't seem like the guard is really necessary. She has a black bag with some memorabilia which she hands out to some of the more enthusiastic fans.
