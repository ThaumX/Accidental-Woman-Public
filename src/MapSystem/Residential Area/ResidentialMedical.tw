<p>@@.head3;T@@he medical area has a large assortment of different buildings, but the gigantic hospital building in the west dwarfs all of them. It's not particularly tall, just large. It's so big that it has a tunnel for traffic passing through it so that the grid of Appletree's streets isn't interrupted. On the other side sits a large assortment of different buildings of varying purposes, housing the private practices of doctors of various specialties and even outpatient medical centers. <<if ‚ÜÇ.pc.trait.op && ‚ÜÇ.pc.trait.perceptive != -1 && ( ‚ÜÇ.skill.probSolving >= 30 || ‚ÜÇ.skill.org >= 40)>><i>It seems odd to you that there is so much medical capacity for a town with less than 100,000 people.

@@.head3;L@@ooking around, there's not a whole lot of activity on the streets, probably due to the time. @@.mono;Well, it's not like people would come here to hang out...@@ You see the occasional patient or doctor heading to one building or another, but that's about it. You see a patient wheeled out of a building up ahead, being pushed by a burly orderly. She has bandages on her head, so you assumes she must've had some cosmetic work done. The odd thing is the fact that she's totally topless, with her breasts on display... But there's probably a reason for that, right?<br><br>

<<f y>>ou visit your assigned general practitioner's office, spending a majority of the time waiting in the waiting room and then waiting in the exam room. When the doctor finally comes in, he gives you a rather <i>interesting</i> examination. He leaves without saying what, exactly, is wrong with you, but soon afterward a nurse comes in and gives you a small injection of a purplish liquid. Her outfit almost seems like some kind of sexy-nurse cosplay, but she's perfectly professional with you. Shortly after the injection you're starting to feel much better.

<p><<f W>>hile Oedipus ‚Ñû's exterior and interior design brings to mind a small-town pharmacy from the 1950s, the goods contained within are thoroughly modern. The store itself is larger on the inside than one might expect from the street. There is a large prescription drug area, that even seems to have a real-life pharmacist behind the counter. There are also some obligatory <<link "advertisements">><<set ‚ÜÇ.flag.sawFertilitySealAd = true>><<dialog "Fertility Seal Ad">><center>[img[IMG-FertilitySealAd]]<br>@@.mono;Huh... This seems like it could be really handy to have, plus it looks pretty cute!@@</center><</dialog>><</link>> for cutting edge drugs and treatments.
</p>
<p>
Unlike some other national chain pharmacies you've been to, however, most of the interior seems to be dedicated to medication and medical devices. The only exception is a small snack and refreshment area near the front styled like an old-timey soda shop. <span id="gene"><<if ‚ÜÇ.pc.trait.perceptive > -1 && !$items.has("Gene Therapy 01")>>You notice a few sheets of printer paper stapled together, laying on the seat of one of the booths of the soda shop area. The paper appears to be quite old, with crinkled edges and a slightly-yellowed color. <<link "Pick them up">><<pickup "$items" "Gene Therapy 01">><<replace "#gene">><</replace>><<run UI.alert("You pick up the paper documents")>><</link>>.<</if>></span>
