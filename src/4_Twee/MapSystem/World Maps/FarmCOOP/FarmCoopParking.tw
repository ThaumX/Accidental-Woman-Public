<p>@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing in what amounts to a large parking lot, though certainly an unusual one. There's a mixture of gravel and cut grass rather than asphalt or concrete. A good portion of the parking is taken up by large farm equipment with blades and chutes and all sorts of things poking out of them. There's also a decent amount of cars parked there, probably belonging to Coop employees and hucows.</p>
