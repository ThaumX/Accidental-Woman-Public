<<f y>>ou spend a little time looking around the corporate campus. Two large buildings occupy most of the ground space, but there are still some nicely landscaped lawns with benches and the occasional fountain. <<if â†‚.pc.trait.perceptive > -1 && $items.has("Gene Therapy 01") && !$items.has("Gene Therapy 02")>>Just as you're about to finish your little walk, you notice a manilla folder with some printer paper inside, tucked out of the way under a bush next to a bench. The paper appears to be intact despite the exposure to the elements, but definitely looks fragile. <<link "Pick it up">><<pickup "$items" "Gene Therapy 02">><<run Dialog.close()>><<run UI.alert("You pick up the paper documents")>><</link>>.<<else>>You notice a small campus directory screen that seems to be glitching. Occassionally a strange logo for a "BPCORP" shows up, but you don't remember seeing that in the list of companies with offices here...<center>[img[IMG-BPCORP]]</center><</if>>
