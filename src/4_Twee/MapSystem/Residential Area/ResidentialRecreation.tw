@@.head3;Y@@u are in the common area at the center of a block of buildings that includes your apartment building. The square block of buildings has a large opening at the center, leaving plenty of room for parking as well as a small neighborhood park. While there isn't a lot of space, they've managed to fit a small playground, some picnic tables, a half-sized basketball court, a BBQ area, and a small grassy area for tanning in the park.
