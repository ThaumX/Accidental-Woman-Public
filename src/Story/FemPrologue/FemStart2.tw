<<f H>>ome at last. A quick shower in tepid water, and you're out on your "balcony" to relax. It's the best part about your tiny apartment. The building used to be a more normal apartment building, but the owner at some point decided to subdivide the units instead of doing a normal renovation. It was a popular trend in the early 20s as more people moved into the city. So your "apartment" is actually a small room made out of part of what used to be a three bedroom place. @@.mono;Not a bad deal, when you think about it... five--maybe six--tenants paying rent instead of one...@@
</p>
<p>
Your "balcony" is the result of some unused space between the rooms, left open for maintenance or structural reasons. Maybe it was just cheaper this way. Whatever the reason, your closet has a small wooden access panel that lets you thread your way down a very narrow stretch of corridor to your balcony. It's little more than a closet-sized space where they didn't bother to cover over the opening to the outside. You'd worry about trespassers, if it weren't the fourth floor.

  <span style="background-color:#ccc;"><b>SEARCH: Burger Tsar Crown Penis</b></span><br>
  <b>From Wankipedia:</b> Burger Tsar is a small regional fast food chain (8 locations) that serves a Russian fusion take on American fast food. It was started in an attempt to take advantage of the temporary fame of the <<message "<span class='blackOutline'>Slav-Squat Tsar</span>.">>The Slav-Squat Tsar is a Russian immigrant who started a school for what he called "squat-aerobics", a combination fitness and sexual technique studio that gained popularity in the early 2020s and managed to spread to a national chain of fitness clubs after garnering the attention of the media and celebrity endorsements. Despite the near-slogan proclamation of "fuck communism comrade!" from the founder, the chain fell on hard times during the <<message "<span class='blackOutline'>GDII</span>">>Great Depression 2, the global economic depression to end all depressions.<</message>> and now consists of only a few remaining locations.<</message>>Burger Tsar has had numerous inquiries and run-ins with the law, and is assumed to have ties to the Russian mafia. The chain's <<message "<span class='blackOutline'>specialties</span>">>Special mayonnaise-based "Man-Sauce", and the cod semen flavored "Russian Sushi"<</message>> have become local favorites in The City, keeping the chain alive despite the numerous allegations. The company's logo and mascot always wear the "tsar crown", which is said to be a replica of the crown of Bestyov IV, which is notable for the gold semi-erect penis ornament that sits in place of the cross found on other crowns. The exact reason for this change is unknown, however historians assume it is related to the rampant inbreeding prevalent in Russian nobility of the time.

<<textnpc>>You're totally Oogling it, lol <<emo laugh>>
<<textpc>>Whatever<br>Like I would care about a crown-cock anyway <<emo tongue>>
<<textnpc>>Okay, okay. so what did Wankipedia say?
<<textpc>>It's a copy of the crown of Bestyov IV, who was apparently pretty crazy due to all the inbreeding.
<<textpc>>Apparently he just REALLY liked cock, lol
<<textnpc>>haha, figures.
<<textnpc>>Hey, I asked earlier, but are you doing anything this weekend?
<<textpc>>Not really, I've got a double shift tomorrow and a shift on Thursday night.
<<textpc>>don't have to be back till the midnight to six shift Monday morning, but I'm pretty low on cash so...
<<textnpc>>OK, good.
<<textnpc>>(about being off Sat, not the low ₢₢₢)<br>Anyway, there's a job fair happening at the Institute on Saturday.
<<textpc>>You know I dropped out of college<br>Unlike you <<emo unamused>>
<<textnpc>><<emo awkward>><br>Yeah, but this fair seems to be focusing on lower-level positions.
<<textnpc>>Apparently there are a lot of vacancies lately... some restructuring and new divisions.

<<textnpc>>I already asked my boss about it and it seems like you could seriously get a job in Appletree

<<f Y>>ou spent another hour and a half talking with Toby about the job fair and your trip to Appletree. Toby has to help out with the job fair, but he promised to give you a short tour and introduce you to some management types to help your chances... @@.mono;It's up to me to make a good impression though. I really wonder what I should wear...@@ You ponder the various aspects of the event in your mind for the rest of the evening. @@.mono;Probably no bra, I don't want to seem too self-aggrandizing...

<span class="head2">The Highway</span> <span class="head3">(in your Misibitchi Lingual)</span><br>
<span class="head3">Friday, 2:33<sub>PM</sub></span><br>
<p>
<<f T>>he nearly bald tires of your beat-up Lingual fill the cabin with a loud hum as you drive down the highway. You finally escaped the congested metro traffic, only to be rewarded by the endless noise as you reach a reasonable speed. You had The Flying Pussy Pounders' new album queued on your car's playlist, but the noise drowns out most of the finer details of the metal piped out of your car's remaining one and a half speakers. You eventually gave up, and swapped over to something random from your playlist. Some familiar electropop club music comes on, along with some blurry memories of being in one state of intoxication or another.
</p>
<p>
You finally get into the swing of the nostalgia, remembering a rather delicious fucking you received in a corner of the VIP section at club Eagle Cunt. You were trying to remember what the stud's face looked like, and failing, when the name of the music's artist popped back into your head. DJ Letters, some crazy Swede guy that was popular for a while... he always wore a silly Penguin hat and a tuxedo T-shirt. @@.mono;I guess you have to do something to stand out, especially in a country full of DJs...@@
</p>
<p>
You decide to stick with the nostalgia train, and push the voice command button on the steering wheel. @@.pc;Play the album for this song.@@ It takes a moment, but you hear your car acknowledge the command by saying something that sounds more like "Ogre" than "Okay". You release a sigh. @@.mono;This car is SO old... There's no way I can afford a replacement.@@ You got the car used, a present for graduating high school. While it has it's faults, it's been with you through a lot. You've spent more than a couple nights asleep in the back seat.
</p>
<p>
You drive, the music and hum of the tires putting you into a sort of trance of your own thoughts, your mind wandering as the road you drive on slowly narrows. Six lanes... four lanes... until eventually you're driving on a two lane road.

<<f Y>>ou look back on the last few days, the struggle to scrape things together for your trip out to Appletree. The time passed in a blur, though physically there wasn't much different from normal. Most of your time was spent preparing for whatever tests and interview questions the Institute would throw your way. You really were pinning your hopes on being able to get a job there. You even had Toby give you some pointers and hints on what to expect... @@.mono;Toby...@@
</p>
<p>
Just as the road your driving on picks up an increasing amount of curves and hills, your trip down memory lane encounters a few twists of its own. Toby. A friend and former co-conspirator, and the source of more than a little romantic angst. A classic tale of bad timing and misunderstood intentions, the kind that would be right at home on a teen NETSCHLIX series. Eventually things became so hopelessly tangled that the two of you simply ended up as good friends instead, never messing with the status quo lest a mistake sends the U.S.S. Drama spiraling off course.
</p>
<p>
There was a point, practically a moment, where it felt like something was going to happen. Whether it would have worked out the way you hoped or not is anyone's guess, but through your rose-tinted glasses it feels like it was the cusp of starting the relationship you had wanted for so long. Of course, that was the point where the trajectory of your life made a dramatic change in course; down, straight down. It's not like anything unexpected happened. The stage was set, the cast was in place, and all the warning signs were there in plain sight... it was blatantly obvious in retrospect. And in the aftermath, whatever chance there had been was gone. You still regret not moving forward and doing something while you had the chance, but it's only one regret of many that has already piled up in your 24 years.
</p>
<p>
Though and any embers of romance have long since smoldered away into ash, the friendship you share with Toby has an odd fragility to it. It almost feels like rather than actually being close, the two of you have some sort of unspoken understanding causing you to act as if you are close. It feels precarious when you think about actually spending time in person with him, rather than just laughing at memes together on the internet.
</p>
<p>
As you've driven the road has continued to become more of a challenge, and you're pulled out of your reverie by a switchback turn and the sudden realization that you're driving on the edge of a cliff, even if there's a guard rail between it and the road.

<<f Y>>ou pay more attention to the road as you continue the drive through the ridge of mountains surrounding Muschi valley. Before long, however, you're starting your descent into the valley. The place looks rather picturesque and somehow untouched by countless decades of development. When you've made it down into the valley proper and your vision is mostly obscured by forest, you see an old-fashioned welcome sign. <span class="ident">Welcome to Muschi Valley - Population: 92,000</span>
</p>
<p>
You drive past a large Bullseye Ubercenter sitting seemingly in the middle of nowhere, and eventually the view to the south opens up. Lots of grass, wild flowers, dotted here and there by stands of trees. Here and there are some fields of one crop or another, but it' a far cry from the giant industrial tracts of land you drove past on the way here.

<<f B>>efore too long you've made your way into Appletree proper. It looks so clean and inviting, it seems almost surreal to you. You follow the directions from your phone to find your way to Toby's place. As you drive you look this way and that, enraptured with the sights like some kind of tourist. @@.mono;Well, I guess in a way I kind of <b><i>am</i></b> a tourist. Hopefully I'll be able to stay here, though... tourists have to go home.@@
</p>
<p>
You arrive at your destination, a three-story townhouse that looks like a mansion. You're still feeling a sense of amazement that you didn't see a single homeless person, pile of trash, or rusted-out car during your drive through town. There was a massive park, and it didn't seem to be an armed outpost or homeless person encampment. Like you could actually walk in it...
</p>
<div id="doorbell">
<<button "Ring the Doorbell">><<replace "#doorbell">>
<p>
Pushing the door buzzer, you're pleasantly surprised to here the echo of melodic chimes coming from inside, rather than the harsh squawk of a buzzer. It isn't long before an older woman answers the door, and you're caught a little off-guard even though you knew Toby might not be the one to answer.
</p>
<p>
She gives you a genial smile. @@.npc;Hello there, dear. You must be Toby's friend <<print ↂ.pc.main.name>>, I'm Toby's mom, but you can call me Lorena.@@
</p>
<p>
You can't quite place it, but there's something that feels <i>off</i> about her smile. @@.pc;Yep that's me. Hello again Lorena, I believe we've met once or twice before.@@ @@.mono;Thank goodness that's all!@@
</p>
<p>
You see something sharp in her gaze for an instant before she answers. @@.npc; Is that so? It must have been before...@@ She pauses for a moment, stepping back from the doorway and holding the door open wider. @@.mono;Before you were put under house arrest for Mariticide, you mean?@@ @@.npc;Where are my manners? Come in, come in!@@
</p>
<p>
With a simple @@.pc;Thanks@@, you step into the seemingly-giant home.
</p>
<p>
She closes the door behind you. @@.npc;I'm afraid Toby has to work late tonight, some unexpected problem or another with the fair coming up tomorrow.@@ She starts walking, leading you into the house. @@.npc;It's a shame, because I was planning on frying up a selection of land oysters I got from Hole Food today for dinner.@@ She looks back, as if to judge your reaction to her choice of cuisine for tonight's meal. @@.npc;Since you are staying with us I thought I'd splurge a little bit, real farm-raised meat is getting expensive these days.@@
</p>
<p>
That's a sentiment you can agree with, especially with your experience at Burger Tsar where it's rare even for vat meat to make it into the food. @@.pc;I know what you mean, It's been a couple months since I've had any real meat, and that was just chicken...@@
</p>
<p>
She pauses in front of the stairs. @@.npc;I'll show you to the guest room and the facilities...@@ She starts up the stairs, with you following. @@.npc;Well, I was thinking it might be easier to just order takeout, but if you'd rather I can cook them up anyway. I've been looking forward to it since I left the store, and you know what they say about prairie oysters...@@
</p>
<p>
You actually don't know, and before you can stop yourself... @@.pc;Actually, I've never had, uh, land oysters before, so...@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Oh my!@@ She chuckles. @@.npc;You're in for a treat then dear, because they are delicious. They say the bigger and fresher the better. Soft, tender, and just bursting with flavor...@@ She seems to be seems to be really anticipating the meal, and is quiet for just a moment as she reaches the landing and starts up the next flight of stairs. @@.pc;The secret is to leave the strings on and sear the outside with egg before you fry them. It seals all the juices inside, and that's where the delicious flavor comes from.@@
</p>
<p>
It's quiet for a few moments before you reach the third floor and she points to the open bathroom. @@.npc;The bath is there, and here is your room... I'm sorry it's a little bit tight with that bed in there.@@ She gestures to the queen-sized bed occupying a good portion of the room.
</p>
<p>
Taking a brief look around, you can't help but think to yourself @@.mono;this "tight" room is bigger than my apartment!@@ @@.pc;Oh, no, this room is great. Thank you for letting me stay with you guys.@@
</p>
<p>
She smiles, it seems a bit more genuine than before... perhaps the thought of land oysters has cheered her up. @@.npc;You're quite welcome, dear. So should I fry up those oysters tonight, or should I just order out? We can always save a plate for Toby when he gets home tonight...@@
