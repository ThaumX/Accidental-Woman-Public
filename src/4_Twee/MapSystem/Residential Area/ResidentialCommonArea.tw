@@.head3;Y@@ou are in the lobby of your apartment building. There is a couch and a couple chairs positioned around a coffee table here, presumably to make waiting for someone more comfortable. There's an elevator and broad stairway at the back,  flanked by two hallways that lead to the first-floor apartments, a shared common room, and a tiny workout room. Opposite of the sitting area, an open doorway leads to the mail room.
