<<textnpc>>Hey <<name>>, I need you to stop by my place this weekend.
<<textpc>>Is something wrong?
<<textnpc>>No, I just want to give you a secure key for the basement lab. I need you here to get your biometrics to go with it, and I figure it'd be better to get it over with.
<<textpc>>Oh, okay. Biometrics?
<<textnpc>>Just finger prints. Mostly. We definitely don't want anyone getting into the lab, do we?
<<textpc>>Yeah, that'd probably be bad...
<<textnpc>>I'm about to start inspecting components to see what needs to be replaced. I could always use an extra hand. [img[IMG_EmoWink]]
<<textpc>>This weekend? I don't know...
<<textnpc>>No, I just need you for like 5-10 minutes this weekend. The component inspection is going to take a lot longer than a weekend.
<<textpc>>Just an inspection?
<<textnpc>>Well, we have to make sure we use working parts if we want the machine to work... so yeah.
<<textpc>>Oh... that makes sense.
<<textnpc>>I'll tell you about it when you're here, in case you want to give me a hand when you have some free time.
<<textnpc>>Which conveniently, you'll be able to do thanks to having access to the lab, lol.
<<textpc>>Okay, I'll stop by. What time?
<<textnpc>>I'll be home all weekend... so anytime from 0800 to say 2300.

<p>
Lily gestures for you to follow her. @@.npc;Come on, let's go get you that access card.@@ She starts walking to the basement stairs. You wait as she opens a complex lock on the door to the stairway, and then follow her down.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-ElectronicsLabSpace]]</center>
<p>
You take a look around the basement lab, and see that it looks completely different than it did the last time you were down here. There's no longer a large conglomeration of electronics in the middle of the open space, instead the room is wide open, giving you a better look at the counters, workbenches, shelves, and storage boxes around the periphery. The floor, however, is completely covered in various pieces, parts, and electronics.
</p>
<p>
You aren't sure what all the various things--or pieces of things--are, but they occupy nearly all the floor space. It almost looks like someone took apart a whole range of appliances--and a tanning bed for good measure--and laid all the resulting pieces out on the floor. Some of them look scorched, and there's a faint smell of warm plastic in the air. A few narrow pathways have been left free of parts, leading to some of the other counters, tools, and desks. The result is a space that looks both spacious and somewhat claustrophobic at the same time. The parts seem to be roughly organized; at least similar-looking things seem to be grouped together on the floor.
</p>
<p>
You look back and see that Lily is standing at the electronics desk in front of a laptop. She's messing with what appears to be a card and card reader. @@.pc;What's this?@@
</p>
<p>
She looks back at you. @@.npc;Just getting your access card ready. Come here so I can scan your thumbprints.@@ She points to a simple fingerprint reader attached to the laptop. You walk over and hold your thumb out. @@.npc;Just push your thumb on the pad and hold it until the light turns green.@@ You comply, first pushing your right thumb onto the pad. When the light turns green, you repeat the process with your left.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Okay, now I need you to push your thumb onto the chip-looking thing on that card.@@ Once you do, you hear the computer chirp. @@.npc;Okay, you're all set.@@ She pulls the card out of the reader. @@.npc;When you want to get in through the basement door, just insert this card into the reader next to the door while you have your thumb on that chip. Then push your thumb on the fingerprint reader, and finally enter the 4-digit PIN. The door will unlock, and you can pull out the access card.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;What's the PIN?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;The PIN is 2625. If you have a hard time remembering it, open the phone on your cell and look at the numbers. The numbers spell cock.@@ She chuckles a bit and then hands you the access card. It's thicker and heavier than you expected.

</p>
<p>
You stand back up reluctantly. @@.pc;Ohhhkay...@@
</p>


:: MSM-GetAccessKeyPass [nobr]


<p>
You take a step closer to Lily, reaching your hand out to grasp her thick tentpole. You whisper seductively @@.pc;How about you let me take care of this for you?@@
</p>
<p>
Lily looks a little surprised, but nods her head. You waste no time getting down on your knees, your hand maintaining constant contact with Lily's cock the whole time. You eagerly pull down her shorts, allowing them to drop to the floor once her cock springs free. Your nose is immediately greeted by a heady mix of masculine and feminine scents. Her arousal is apparent; her balls glisten with moisture from her pussy while her cock strains upward and a bead of pre forms at the tip.
</p>
<p>
Grasping her thick rod in one hand, you waste no time slipping its head into your mouth. You savor the faint flavor as you slowly run your tongue over the hard flesh. You take your other hand and caress her balls before allowing them to rest in the palm of your hand. You can't help but notice that they seem a good deal larger than you remember, but quickly dismiss the thought. Your fingers curl upward, exploring the delicate folds of her cunt that are already wet with her nectar. You begin a steady bobbing motion with your head, pressing your tongue against the sensitive underside of her member as you gradually take her cock deeper each time. You feel her sack tightening up in your hand as her cock tenses up in your mouth, and you know she's getting close.
</p>
<p>
Taking a deep breath through your nose, you push your head forward once more. This time you allow the thick head of Lily's dick past the back of your mouth and into your throat. Swallowing reflexively at the intrusion, you keep pushing forward until your nose touches her abdomen. The additional sensation pushes Lily over the edge, and you feel surge in her cock as it sprays the first rope of jizz down your throat. You quickly pull backward in time for the next spurt of cum to flood your mouth. You savor the flavor as you hold her twitching member firmly in your mouth. You're forced to swallow multiple times before Lily has finished depositing her massive load in your mouth.
</p>
<p>
Without releasing her flesh pole from your mouth, you give her a few moments to calm down before you start sucking at her cockhead to collect the dregs of her orgasm. Squeezing with your thumb against the underside of her cock, you drag your thumb from the base all the way to your chin and are rewarded with another dollop of Lily's delicious semen. @@.mono;Why is Lily's cum so damned delicious?@@
</p>
<p>
You finally release her, sitting back on your butt to give your knees a break. You lick Lily's lubricant from your hand seductively as she slowly collects herself. When she finally bends over and pulls her shorts up from the floor, you climb back to your feet. She surprises you with a kiss, her tongue delving into your mouth briefly before she pulls away. @@.npc;Thanks for that, that felt great.@@

  <<textpc>>Well don't keep me waiting!
  <<textnpc>>We're finally finished with inspecting the parts for the rejuvenator. Everything's all organized and ready for assembly when we're ready.
  <<textnpc>>There's also some bad news though...
  <<textpc>>Of course...
  <<textnpc>>A lot of the electronics were damaged by the excessive current, I was expecting that though. Also pretty much all of the rare/hard-to-get/expensive components are broken too.
  <<textpc>>What does that mean?
  <<textnpc>>I'm not sure yet. I think I'll be able to repair/rebuild some of them hopefully. Some I might be able to salvage a bit from, but will have to be replaced. I'll know more once I've had time to inspect them in more detail.
  <<textpc>>Okay, so it sounds like it could be worse.
  <<textnpc>>It also turns out that pretty much every single EM coil is ruined, nearly all of them were hand-wound. The copper wire is ruined, so we'll need to get new wire and wind it for new magnets...
  <<textnpc>>The silver lining is that It's going to take me time evaluating those components anyway, so we really won't be wasting time.
  <<textpc>>But basically you just need to buy some copper wire?
  <<textnpc>>Basically, but it's not your average wire from the hardware store. It's a small gauge with thin insulation, basically the kind intended for electromagnets.
  <<textnpc>>It's fairly expensive, but the bigger issue is that we can't just buy it in bulk without attracting attention... So that's the next task: acquiring copper wire.
  <<textpc>>So how are you going to do it?
  <<textnpc>>Buy it in small batches from a contact in the industrial district.
  <<textnpc>>Of course that means there's going to be a "markup" on top of losing the savings from buying in bulk.
  <<textnpc>>Copper itself is already about ₢3 per pound. If we're lucky we'll get the enameled wire for ₢18 per pound.
  <<textpc>>Oh, that doesn't sound too bad?
  <<textnpc>>We need a few hundred pounds.
  <<textpc>>Oh.
  <<textnpc>>You're always welcome to help out with the purchasing, but my lab assistant can take care of it with enough time.
  <<textnpc>>I think we could speed things up even more if you were willing to spend some money, but it isn't necessary.
  <<textpc>>Well, I'll stop by the lab sometime and see what I can do.

  <<textnpc>>Hey <<name>>, I've finally wrangled up sources for all the special components.
  <<textpc>>Oh, that's good news, right?
  <<textnpc>>Yes and no...
  <<textnpc>>It's good that we'll be able to get what we need. The methods for getting some of them aren't so great.
  <<textpc>>Oh... I see.
  <<textnpc>>Have you ever heard of a guy named Oleg Bestarius?
  <<textpc>>I think... Isn't he that guy that runs the Slavsquat school?
  <<textnpc>>Well yes, but he also has plenty of connections with the Russian Mafia...
  <<textpc>>And I'm guessing we need something from them?
  <<textnpc>>Well, in a roundabout way... you know how it is with the Russians.
  <<textpc>>Umm... Batshit Crazy?
  <<textnpc>>Well yes, but they should also be willing to make some credits on a certain item they don't have any use for.
  <<textpc>>You hope.
  <<textnpc>>Yeah, I hope.
  <<textpc>>So you're going to need a hand.
  <<textnpc>>Yeah, please. I don't want to get Sara involved in this, it'd be pretty hard to explain.
  <<textpc>>Okay, I'll stop by.
  <<textnpc>>There's several other rare things to get our hands on too, besides the Russian thing.
  <<textpc>>Of course, lol
  <<textnpc>>Well, none are dangerous like that, at least.
  <<textnpc>>There's no rush though, I won't need them until a little later in the assembly. Still, it'd be best to get started rather than wait till the last minute.
  <<textpc>>Sure.
  <<textnpc>>Thanks, I'll leave some instructions in case I'm out of the lab.<<replace "#pasty">><<safetoclose>><</replace>>
