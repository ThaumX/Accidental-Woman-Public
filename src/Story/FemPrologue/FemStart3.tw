Your best guess is some kind of misshapen fried meatball or perhaps some kind of fat sausage. The two of you sit down at the small table in the kitchen to eat.

<<f I>>t's a smaller TV at only <<unit 45 in>>, but you're pleased to find that it's connected to cable. You spend a few minutes browsing through the different series available, but you're not really in the mood for any of the shows that would normally catch your interest. Eventually you decide to just put it on a live stream, picking one at random. You catch the tail end of a commercial for what looks like some kind of anal salve called BÄKPÜSSI. Afterward, it returns to the currently airing show.
</p>
<center>[img[IMGrapeescape]]</center>
<p>
@@.mono;Oh, I think I saw an ad for this... It seems a little different than I was expecting.@@ The show still seems to be near the beginning, based on the voiceover that starts explaining the first challenge. The show seems to be about a bunch of women trying to escape from various obstacle courses and mazes while clad only in protective gear, while avoiding traps and masked rapists. The contestants are competing for credit prizes at the finish, with bonus time or credits for completing challenges during or between events that seem to involve some sort of oral activity or devices placed in their rears.
</p>
<p>
It appears that if a contestant finishes the series of challenges she gets to keep whatever credits she earned along the way, but only the winner gets the grand prize and the chance to double-down. @@.mono;probably some sort of double or nothing challenge that's insanely difficult.@@ The challenges don't look easy, and there are quite a few contestants. It seems that if one of the rapists manage to get their cock in a contestant's pussy, the contestant loses. Unlike what you were expecting based on the preview, it seems that not only are the contestants knocked out of the running, they might also get knocked up.
</p>
<p>
As you're watching, one of the contestants gets caught in some kind of guillotine-like trap while trying to reach into a wall to grab a bonus. She's left stuck with her lower body sticking out of the wall with her ass and pussy on display. Worse, the awkward height and angle of the trap have left her with her knees bent outward and her legs spread wide against the wall. The show's hosts gleefully discuss the contestant's odds of escaping in time as the show goes back to a montage of other contestants running the challenge. The show leaves a camera view open in the corner showing the trapped girl, and it isn't long before it shows one of the excessively-well-endowed rapists moving up behind her.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;<i>Well it looks like Mary isn't going home with a cash prize!</i>@@ The girl starts wiggling and struggling when she feels the masked man's huge member poke against one of her thighs. Her efforts are pretty obviously hopeless, however, as the trap is preventing her from doing much more than delaying the inevitable slightly. The rapist gives her a hard smack on the ass before firmly grasping both ass cheeks. From there it only takes a moment to line up before he thrusts into her all at once.
</p>
<p>
The show continues with the trapped contestant getting fucked shown on an inset at the bottom left of the screen. The other contestants all seem to make it through this challenge, though there's a few close calls here and there. At one point the camera focuses on the challenge's winner who has decided to go for "the golden egg" which seems to be worth ₢5,000 if she makes it to the end. She has to climb sideways along a rock climbing wall over a pool of semen substitute to reach the egg. The wall doesn't appear too challenging, with plenty of hand and foot holds, so she makes it quickly across to stand in front of a pedestal displaying a gold-colored egg about twice the size of a normal chicken egg. She grabs the large egg from it's pedestal and holds it up victoriously. She suddenly nearly drops it, fumbling for a moment before luckily catching it between her breasts and arm.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;<i>Ahh haha, Sara should have known better being a fan of the show! That egg will vibrate until she beats the final challenge, and if she drops it, she'll have to carry it her ass instead!</i>@@ The previously confident woman now looks a bit concerned as she realizes that she has to carry the violently-vibrating egg back across the cum moat. She experiments with trying to hold it in her mouth, but the egg is too large to fit inside and the vibration defies her attempts to hold onto it with her lips. With drooping shoulders Sara squats down and dips the pointy side of the egg into the pool of cum. @@.npc;<i>Oh ho! It seems Sara is going to insert the egg herself! That's a smart move folks; if she she loses that one I doubt our referee would lube up the replacement!</i>@@
</p>
<p>
As soon as sara manages to get the egg inside her the screen shifts to show a full-size view of the trapped girl. The rapist is pounding her with rapid-fire thrusts now, and the camera cuts to the other side of the trap to show Mary's practically-drooling face as she has another orgasm. @@.npc;<i>Well Mary may not be getting any money, but <b>nobody</b> on</i> The Great Rape Escape <i>goes home empty handed! She'll be getting our runner-up baby shower package to go along with the bundle of joy we...</i>@@ The host pauses for a moment as the rapist hilts himself with one final thrust, obviously enjoying his own orgasm. @@.npc;<i>... the baby we just put inside her!</i>@@
</p>
<p>
The hosts start discussing the upcoming challenge with the screen still showing the rapist coming down from his orgasm while buried inside the hapless contestant. The masked rapist finally pulls out of his victim, and soon after a veritable flood of their mixed fluids start pouring out of her to splash on the floor. This seems to drive the studio audience wild, as their cheers cause the hosts to stop talking for a moment while waiting for the crowd to quiet down.
</p>
<p>
After that, the program went to commercial break, and the TV started showing some <<message "local commercials">><center>[img[IMG-SurrogacyCenter]]<br>[img[IMG-JustSayNo1]]</center><</message>>. Despite finding The Great Rape Escape much more <i>interesting</i> than you expected, you still find yourself feeling rather tired.

I don't want to cause a scene right now of all times, and it's not like I can even get away from whoever it is with all these people in the way.@@ Having resigned yourself to the forced caress, you clench your jaw and your cheeks.
</p>
<<case 2>>
<p>
<<f T>>he firm pressure on your rear end was startling at first, but also rather exciting. @@.mono;I've been worked up since watching that show last night, and it's probably toby anyway...@@ A little bit of fun on the bus seems like a good way to ease your nerves before everything happening at the institute today... You subtly change how you're standing, leaning forward and arching your lower back, which has the result of pushing your ass out towards your assailant.
</p>
<p>
The pervert seems to appreciate your response, and gives your ass a little extra attention before the hand resumes its activities.
</p>
<<case 3>>

<<f Y>>ou quickly consider your options. @@.mono;If it was Toby, I don't think I'd mind all that much, but things being what they are... I doubt it's him. It's probably some gross pervert.@@ You play it cool for just a few moments, preparing yourself to turn suddenly and catch the pervert ass-handed. Once you're ready, you twist suddenly, rotating your legs on the balls of your feet, and twisting your upper body and neck so you can look directly behind you...
</p>
<p>
But it seems your attempt failed. @@.mono;Damn! me tensing up must've tipped the bastard off...@@ There are several people behind you who could be your assailant. Toby is there, though his body is facing sideways. He'd still be able to grab at you with ease though. There's a woman in her mid-thirties dressed in a skirt suit behind you, but she seems occupied by whatever is on her phone and hasn't even looked up. There's also a middle-aged balding man with an obvious beer belly that's could also be the offender. He's looking at you, but glances away quickly when your eyes meet.
</p>
<p>
With no success, and feeling the discomfort of having your body unnaturally twisted around, you turn back to your original position. Just in time, too, as another sway from the bus causes the passengers to shift slightly. It'll be hard to turn around like that again. Almost immediately afterward, though, you feel the hand resume its exploration.
</p>
<<case 4>>
<p>
<<f Y>>ou decide to just keep doing nothing, hoping that the groping hand will give up when it doesn't get a rise out of you. At some point you stopped thinking of the person molesting you as being Toby, as you realize that he isn't the type of person who'd do this. @@.mono;Not that he <b>wouldn't</b> do it, I just know that we would've talked about it first.@@ You try to focus and keep from making a scene, but that's something the exploring hand is making increasingly difficult.

<<f W>>ith your eyes closed you silently urge-on the mysterious groper @@.mono;Keep going, you're almost there...@@ You bite your lower lip as you focus on feeling anything that happens between your legs. Without thinking about it, your heels spread outward as your weight rests on the balls of your feet. This reflexive motion opens your legs further, and causes your skirt to ride up further on its own. While you doubt that you're revealing your underwear to anyone, you've made it pretty easy for the mysterious hand to touch whatever it'd like.

<<f D>>etermined to catch the pervert molesting you from behind, you try to act like you've resigned yourself to the unwanted touch of your assailant. You let your shoulders droop, but otherwise stay still, as if you're simply waiting for the inevitable. The exploring hand makes quick progress back up your leg as you wait for just the right moment to launch your second attempt at catching the unknown pervert.
</p>
<p>
Sensing that the time is right, you quickly reach around behind you to catch the pervert's arm. You start turning your head, hoping to catch an early glimpse of the assailant in your peripheral vision. It seems that you overestimated your ability to blindly grab something though, as your hand closes around nothing but air. Your assailant doesn't have that problem, however, as you feel a hand firmly grasp the back of yours and pull. Your arm is pulled further across your lower back, and there is a pain in your shoulder as well as your wrist as you're put into an impromptu arm lock.
</p>
<p>
There is a menacing twist that sends a streak of pain shooting up your arm. You quickly get the message, and turn your head back around front. It takes only a moment afterward for you to feel the hand from earlier resuming its perverted exploration.

The hand continues down the back of your thigh, reaching the hem of your skirt. Then the hand is no longer outside your clothing, but is instead gently touching your inner thigh. It doesn't linger long, however, before it starts moving upward, brushing your delicate skin along the way. The assailant doesn't seem to mind that they're lifting the hem of your skirt upward, causing the garment to ride up your thighs toward your butt.
</p>
<<case 2>>
<p>
It doesn't take long for the hand to reach your vulva, with only a thin strip of fabric remaining to keep the pervert's hand from touching you directly. The hand doesn't seem to care, however, as it starts pushing and rubbing against your most sensitive areas. This continues for a little while, <<if ↂflag.prologueBusReaction[2] !== 5>>as your body completely ignores your opinion on the matter and responds to the stranger's touch.<<else>>as you enjoy the unexpected foreplay.<</if>> Suddenly the hand grips one edge of your underwear and drags it off to the side, exposing your pussy to the air and the stranger's fingers.

@@.mono;Enough is enough!@@
</p>
<p>
<<f Y>>ou decide that you aren't going to put up with this molestation any longer. Raising your voice, you nearly yell @@.pc;Can someone help me‽ There's a molester who keeps rubbing my butt and thighs, they just stuck their hand up my skirt!@@
</p>
<p>
While you did manage to get the attention of the people nearby, there wasn't the kind of serious reaction that you were expecting. Some people started looking around at the people next you, but most of those who aren't near you just go back to whatever they were doing. Toby looks a little confused, and it seems nobody really knows what to do.
</p>
<p>
Just before you start to give up hope, an man stands up from the seat he was in and speaks up. @@.npc;Okay folks, let's get this taken care of.@@ The older man is wearing a nice suit, and seems to be in his 50s. @@.npc;Okay you two, can you move to the side so I can change places with the young woman please?@@
</p>
<p>
The two people standing in front of him don't move right away; it's obvious that they're uncertain how exactly to accomplish the task. @@.npc;Come on people, make like the Red Sea, and part!@@ With that he put his hands between the two people and pushed them apart, making a gap and causing a ripple through the nearby passengers as they were forced closer together. Once there was enough room, he gestured at his seat. @@.npc;Go ahead and have a seat miss.@@
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, nobody openly protested being pushed around by the older man. One 30-something woman started to say something that was undoubtedly going to be quite rude, but shut her mouth when she caught sight of the target of her ire. For yourself, you uttered a simple @@.pc;thank you@@ to the older man as you squeezed by him and sat in his seat.
</p>
<p>
Once the man reached your former spot--facing the opposite direction of course--he spoke up again. @@.npc;Did anyone see anything that happened?@@ He looked around at the people that were standing behind you.
</p>
<p>
A woman wearing a skirt suit spoke up. @@.npc;Sir, I saw that man there reaching toward her with his hand, but I couldn't see exactly what he was doing.@@ She was pointing straight at Toby, who had turned as white as a sheet.
</p>
<p>
Toby answered the accusation nervously. @@.pc;Ah, umm, sir, I didn't do anything sir. Really!@@ His stammering voice didn't do much in favor of his innocence.

Is he... going to fuck me? here, on the bus?@@ Your mind goes wild while you wait for the what happens next. Fortunate or not, you don't have to wait long.
</p>
<p>
You feel what seems to be two fingers make contact with the hood of your clit. You nearly jump in surprise, your muscles having coiled like a spring while waiting for this touch to come. The two fingers run downward, brushing over your clit and then slipping in between your inner lips. They continue their stroke, stopping only once they reach your entrance. Rather than plunge inside, as you expected, they start to open; the two digits spreading your labia and exposing your sensitive vestibule to the air. A third digit, likely the middle finger, suddenly makes contact and pushes inside you.
</p>
<p>
The finger pauses inside you for just a moment before sliding back outward. Then all of a sudden--certainly sooner than you expected--the hand is gone. You wait nervously for over a minute in case the pervert's hand returns, but it doesn't. You breathe a sign of relief, glad that this unpleasant episode seems to be over.

Am I going to have sex here on this bus in front of all these people? Whatever, just don't leave me hanging!@@ As much as you were craving a good fucking, at this point you would settle for some fingering or whatever else the stranger was willing to give. Fortunately you didn't have to wait long.

<p>
You feel what seems to be two fingers make contact with the hood of your clit. You nearly moan, the tense anticipation causing the touch to take you by surprise.

Rather than plunge inside, as you expected, they start to open; the two digits spreading your labia and exposing your sensitive vestibule to the air. A third digit, likely the middle finger, suddenly makes contact and pushes inside you.
</p>
<p>
The finger pauses inside you for just a moment before making a few gentle in-and-out strokes and sliding back outward. After the finger is free, the hand gives your vulva a few soft pats, as if saying "good girl". With that the hand disappears, sooner than you expected and far sooner than you had hoped. You wait hopefully for over a minute in case the hand returns, but it doesn't. You sigh in disappointment, being left aroused and unfulfilled leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth about the encounter. You can't help but wonder @@.mono;Why come so far to just stop like that?@@
</p>
<<case 6>>
<p>
<<f U>>nderestimating an opponent is a serious mistake, one that you know you'll soon have to pay for.

The wait for the criminal's next move seems unbearable, though it is little more than a moment. @@.mono;At least wear a condom, I don't want to get pregnant.

<p>
<<f T>>he bus slows and comes to a stop, but rather than seeing buildings outside the window, you see only trees. Looking around, you can see the other passengers becoming agitated.
</p>
<p>
A feminine voice calls out. @@.npc;Hey, what's going on‽ If this bus doesn't get moving I'm going to be late!@@
</p>
<p>
A masculine voice answers. @@.npc;We're only a few hundred <<if $AW.metric>>meters<<else>>yards<</if>> from the main stop, we can walk.@@
</p>
<p>
There are murmurs of assent among the passengers, and you hear the doors sliding open. Another question is posed by a woman with youthful voice. @@.npc;What's going on, anyway? Why'd the bus stop?@@
</p>
<p>
A series of shouts relays the question up to the front of the first cabin, while people start piling off the bus. As the occupancy in your own cabin declines, you get a better view outside and can see that there's actually a sidewalk that runs alongside the four-lane road. Several anxious institute employees are already walking hurriedly towards the campus.
</p>
<p>
The outflux of passengers means that there's finally enough room to regroup with Toby. The shout communication network returns with the answer to the earlier question. @@.npc;It's the fucking Femstapo. They are blocking the road.@@
</p>
<p>
There are several groans, and you hear a young woman speak up. @@.npc;Hey! Don't call them that, that's misogynist. How do you even know they're feminist protesters‽@@ The groaning intensifies.
</p>
<p>
You catch a snarky reply. @@.npc;Who else could it be with hair like that?@@ There are several chuckles, though you can't see the <<message "hair in question.">>[img[IMG-FemstapoHair]]<</message>>
</p>
<p>
Once you're able to make it over to Toby, you can see out the window well enough to see what's going on. There's a row of women with unusual hair and signs that are blocking the road. Many of them are carrying signs, though you can only make out one: "OPENING JOBS FOR MEN DISCRIMINATES AGAINST WOMEN!"
</p>
<p>
You nudge Toby @@.pc;What's all this about?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;You know those feminist protestors that get paid with a gift loophole so they can still collect full government benefits? They call them the femstapo, you know, because they're female supremacists or whatever.@@ He gives you a shrug, but doesn't look away from the scene outside.
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Yeah, I don't live under a rock, I know who they are. I want to know why they're protesting the Institute.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Probably because of the job fair, and because the Institute is so strongly connected to the government. I've heard that they're angry that the Institute allows men to apply for jobs that can be done by women, instead of making them female-only... But who really knows with these people?@@ He shakes his head. @@.npc;I can tell you one thing, I doubt this is going to turn out well for those women.@@
</p>
<p>
Just then an air-bike sets down in the middle of the road near the bus, and a security guard that looks more like the member of a paramilitary organization climbs off. He lifts a megaphone to address the protesters, and they all start screaming chants to drown him out. The megaphone is either quite powerful, or simply because you're closer to him than the protesters, you can hear what he announces.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY IN ABSENTIA OF UNLAWFUL DEMONSTRATION AND FELONY TRESPASSING, AND EACH OF YOU HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT THE POSIBILITY OF PAROLE, TO BE SERVED BY INDENTUREMENT TO THE THORTON INSTITUTE. YOUR SENTENCE BEGINS IMMEDIATELY. KNOW THAT DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS WILL DELAY THE AVAILABILITY OF THE APPEALS PROCESS. GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES AND PLACE YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD TO SUBMIT TO INPROCESSING. YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS.@@
</p>
<p>
The protestors ignore the warning from the man, continuing their chanting with a mix of insults. You're close enough to see that rather than making the man angry, their antics have put a smile on his face. That's when you hear the first scream. The sound of the protesters suddenly goes quiet, as they've each been subdued by black security robots of some kind.
</p>
<p>
The security guard makes a new announcement. @@.npc;PRISONERS THAT DID NOT COMPLY WITH INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED COMBATITIVE. AS SUCH, FEDERAL POLICY REQUIRES A FULL CAVITY SEARCH FOR WEAPONS AND CONTRABAND BEFORE ADMITTANCE TO THE INPROCESSING FACILITY.@@ He makes a rotating hand gesture with his finger toward the bots and subdued protestors. The bots move out of the way of traffic while carrying their new charges, and this happens to line them up in a display like fashion along the side of the road. Moments later, the bots are cutting away the women's clothing, leaving all 30 or so women naked.
</p>
<p>With the road cleared, traffic slowly starts moving again. You see the bots all bring out a ridiculously large cylinder on a multi-articulated arm. @@.mono;Those cylinders look a lot like an extra-large vibrators...@@ and that's when you realize that they're the cavity search probes. @@.mono;That is definitely going to hurt!@@ You feel a twinge of sympathetic pain between your legs, and are glad that the moving bus carries you out of view of the protestors before the bots have a chance to use those probes on them.
</p>
<p>
You glance over at Toby. @@.pc;Holy shit Toby. The institute enslaves people? Also, why the hell would they be protesting like that if they're going to be enslaved?@@
</p>
<p>
Toby shrugs as if it isn't really a big deal. @@.npc;It's not really that strange, when you think about it. The Institute is basically the government here, and the rest is par for the course when it comes to a prison corp. Those protesters probably thought it would make a good disruption, and that they'd get a slap on the wrist like usual. I don't think the Institute goes out of it's way to warn off potential test subjects...@@
