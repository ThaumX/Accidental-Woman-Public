<p>@@.head3;Y@@ou are standing in the sand of the artificial beach set up on the west side of Hoden Springs. The water of the springs is cool and crystal-clear, though the constant ripples from the falling water of springs on the cliff face keep you from seeing anything too clearly. You can tell that the pond is quite deep, though, with some dark shadows at the base of the cliff.</p>
