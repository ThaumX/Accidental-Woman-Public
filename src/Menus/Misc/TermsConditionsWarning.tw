<p style="color:goldenrod;font-size:1.1rem;">

<img data-passage="IMG-LforLewd" style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px 15px 25px;">
Accidental Woman is a game <b style="color:yellow;">for adults only</b>. You must be 18 years old, or the legal age in your country, to play this game. This game contains sexual activities, situations, and images. Two layers of content filters are available to help you avoid content you don't wish to see. As an in-development game, these filters may not always work, and you may be exposed to content you didn't wish to see (<i>such as the incredibly perverse act of <span class="pink">handholding</span>, sometimes called 'holding hands'</i>).
</p>
<p>
Additionally, AW (Accidental Woman) allows loading of game mods and customizations, which can include content, items, images, and more. The developers are not responsible for any unofficial content you load into the game. <i>Additional content filters <b>are</b> provided for mod authors to use with their work, but we obviously can't force them to do so.</i>
</p>
<p>
Playing this game requires that you agree to the <<link "Terms and Conditions">><<intgo "TermsConditionsWarning2">><</link>>. Content licensed for use in AW remains the property of its owners. Original art, writing, and code remains the property of ThaumX, all rights reserved. If you believe you've found an instance of incorrect attribution or unauthorized use of any material in this game, <b>please</b> contact the developers via www.thaumx.com so we can correct the issue as soon as possible.
