@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing on a walking street winding through a block of redbrick buildings. Unlike the strait and open sidewalks of the rest of downtown, the adult district is mostly narrow curving alleys. It has a mysterious or even romantic atmosphere, disrupted by the occasional sign reminding citizens that prostitution is illegal or any number of other public service messages.

<<f y>>ou take some time to explore some of the side streets and alleys of the Appletree Adult District. The Adult District is by far the most labyrinthian area of Appletree, pretty much the only area where you could get turned around or otherwise lose your way. The layout gives the area a certain mystique, along with the mental illusion of privacy and anonymity. Of course, nothing about the area actually prevents cameras and other tools of surveillance from working just as well as anywhere else... it's just a little easier to forget about them.
</p>
<p>
While wandering the Adult district is a good way to kill some time, you're more likely to stumble upon something interesting here after all, that doesn't mean it's always an eventful journey. This time, like most times, you don't actually come across anything unusual.

<<f y>>ou take some time to wander the side streets and alleys of the Appletree Adult District. You glance down a narrow alleyway as you walk past, and notice a drunk woman relieving herself. There's no shortage of public restrooms in Appletree, though you suppose they aren't as convenient to get to here in the Adult District. The woman doesn't seem to notice you as you walk slowly by, and you wonder if she's more than just drunk.

<<f y>>ou take some time to wander the side streets and alleys of the Appletree Adult District. Near the end of your explorations, you round the corner and emerge in something of a courtyard that's really just a wider section of alley that happens to have a storefront. This would be perfectly ordinary, except for the woman squatting and peeing on the sidewalk. Even that isn't <i>terribly</i> unusual, though people usually choose to be more discrete. What's unusual is how surprised she is to be caught.
</p>
<p>
The look of incredulous surprise on her face causes you to laugh involuntarily, and she just stares at you angrily from her squatting position. Still chuckling you start walking back to the main street.

After walking by an establishment that is something like a love hotel, you hear moaning and the telltale rhythmic slap of flesh against flesh nearby. Curious, you walk down the alley next to the hotel to find the source of the noise.
</p>
<p>
You reach an intersection and immediately spot a couple going at it pretty hard. @@.mono;I wonder why they're doing it here, they could have rented a bed right over there...@@ The woman finally notices you standing there, and flashes you a grin. @@.mono;Oh, I guess that explains it....@@

<<f y>>ou take some time to explore some of the side streets and alleys of the Appletree Adult District. On one of the side streets a crier catches your attention. @@.npc;Adult peep show! Only ten credits to watch!@@ He's dressed in a polo shirt and khaki, and looks like he should be on a golf course rather than here.
</p>
<p>
You walk up to the man, curious. @@.pc;Peep show? What's that about?@@
</p>
<p>
He gives you a salesman's smile. @@.npc;Peep show with a twist... There's a snatched girl stuck in the room until she earns enough to go free. Discerning guests such as yourself can offer her credits to do whatever you want her to. If she does, she earns the creds. If she doesn't, you keep them.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;What do you mean by "snatched"?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;You know, grabbed off the street. It's the easiest way to do it.@@ He gives you a knowing grin. @@.npc;You see there's usually a matter of money involved... It's just a creative form of debt assistance, really. The key is that the girl doesn't get any food or anything, so they start getting pretty desperate to escape... It can get pretty freaky, if you catch my drift.@@
</p>
<p>
You think about it for a moment. @@.pc;Just ten creds?@@
</p>
<p>
He nods. @@.npc;Ten credits, one hour. Time is extended if the girl accepts an offer from you.@@
</p>
<center><<button "WATCH">><<addTime 40>><<replace "#peeper">>
<p>
You transfer the credits and make your way down a curved hallway to enter your assigned booth.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-PeepShow]]</center>
<p>
You see an unhappy girl sitting next to a small bed, the only furnishing in the room. You hear a female voice being replayed through the speaker in your cubicle. @@.npd;Damnit, they never tell you when it's a fresh catch. This is a waste of time.@@ You hear a door slam closed shortly afterward.
</p>
<p>
A man's voice comes through the speaker. @@.npe;Come on girl, you know you aren't gettin' outta there until you collect enough creds... You might as well perform and get it over with. Why don't you start by takin' off the rest of them clothes?@@
</p>
<p>
The girl doesn't respond, and just sits there staring at the floor.
</p>
<p>
@@.npe;You're going to earn that money one way or another. You better do it now while the requests are easy. You're gonna get desperate, and that's when the crazy starts.@@
</p>
<p>
This time a female voice speaks up. @@.npc;I've got a hundred creds if you bite your nipple till it bleeds.@@
</p>
<p>
@@.npe;See what I mean?@@ There's a pause while everyone waits. @@.npe;Dumb slut...@@
</p>
<p>
The girl finally stands up and without emotion strips off all her clothes. When she does, you notice the number on an LED sign decrease. Looks like she still has nearly 3,000 credits left to earn.
</p>
<p>
The girl doesn't do much for the rest of your time, a couple jumping jacks and some bad dancing due to the lack of music. She ignores most of the requests, including yours. As you make your way back out into the alley, you wonder what the show will be like once the girl starts getting desperate.

<<f y>>ou take some time to wander the side streets and alleys of the Appletree Adult District. Your path eventually leads you to a small sex arcade. Curious, you take a closer look. It really isn't much more than a hole in the wall, a small room on the other side of the wide entryway. There's an attendant there to collect money and keep an eye on the merchandise, which is all on display in a large cylinder in the center of the room. Girls are bent over with their asses hanging out of the wall, ready to be fucked. There's a picture taped to the wall above each girl, though you realize there's probably no way of knowing if the girls actually look like the pictures.

<<f y>>ou take some time to explore some of the side streets and alleys of the Appletree Adult District. It's a pretty uneventful trip, but then you make a turn into an unfamiliar alleyway. While you're walking you suddenly hear a man shouting something, but you can't make out the actual words. Shortly after, you hear a scream that is suddenly cut short.
</p>
<p>
The noise seems like it could be coming from up ahead, but it's really hard to be sure. The brick buildings and network of alleys have a way of carrying sound in strange ways. You decide to keep going, moving more cautiously and keeping an eye out for any potential threats.
</p>
<p>
You soon arrive at a sort of kink in the alley, where it turns left before turning right a short distance later. It's not an unusual layout. What <b>is</b> unusual is the struggling form at the other end of the bend.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-AlleyEncounter]]</center>
<p>
Right there, in the middle of the alley is some sort of... tentacle creature. @@.pc;Holy shit!@@ you exclaim in shock as you make out the form of a man struggling weakly to escape. You don't see any eyes on the strange creature, but you get the sudden impression that it's aware of your presence. You turn around and run, fleeing as fast as you're able until you find yourself back on the main street.

<<f a>>s you make your way down a side street, you're surprised when a door suddenly opens in a dark corner of the street. The doorway casts light into the darkness, and reveals the silhouette of a man in a hoodie standing there.
</p>
<p>
He must've noticed you, because he calls out. @@.npc;Hey, you want to see something crazy?@@
</p>
<p>
@@.pc;Ah, no thanks@@ you answer reflexively, your subconscious naturally wary of the situation.
</p>
<p>
@@.npc;Well you better keep moving then. I'm gonna open this garage, and you'll see it whether you want to or not if you keep standing there.@@
</p>
<center><<button "LEAVE">><<run Dialog.close()>><</button>> <<button "STAY">><<replace "#alleytent">>
<p>
You stand there, unmoving. Your curiosity prevents you from fleeing and the man simply says @@.npc;Suit yourself.@@ You see the figure move, and suddenly there's the squeaking noise of a garage door rolling open along with a line of dim yellow light that appears in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
The line of yellow light grows into a rectangle as the garage door raises. It's a small garage, for storage rather than vehicles; you have a hard time imagining a car fitting inside, even if it could navigate the streets to get here. Instead it seems to contain a dark mass of <i>something</i> that occupies the back of the space.
</p>
<p>
You sense movement, and you take a few steps forward to try and get a better look at whatever is inside.
</p>
<center>[img[IMG-AlleyTentacleGirl]]</center>
<p>
What you see inside certainly fits the definition of crazy. A naked woman, trapped in a mass of flesh and tentacles. The flesh seems to pulsate at a regular rhythm, while some of the tentacles are busy fucking the girl in every hole. One even seems to be burrowed into her ear canal. She's wearing a strange headset that reminds you of those EEG machines.
</p>
<p>
You see the silhouette appear in front of the garage light. @@.npc;How are you doing tonight, dear?@@
</p>
<p>
You don't know if the man is talking to the trapped girl or the creature trapping her, and you don't wait around to find out. You quickly walk back the way you came, leaving the darkness and strange scene behind you.
