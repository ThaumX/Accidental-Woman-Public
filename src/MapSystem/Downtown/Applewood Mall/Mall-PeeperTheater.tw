@@.head3;A@@fter making your way up the escalator to the second floor, you find yourself in a reasonably-sized lobby overlooking the food court. The lobby contains a ticket booth on the far wall along with the entrance to the cineplex, one wall is dedicated to posters of the "Now-Playing" movies, and there is also a few chairs and small tables to relax or wait for friends. The Now-Playing wall is currently decorated with a banner that says "Classic Film Expos√©: Take A Peek!"

:: DowntownMallPeeperLOC [nobr]

You notice a young woman who seems to be waiting for a friend or date to show up. She seems rather bored, and has slipped off her shoes to put her feet up on the chair. She's swinging her knees open and closed, likely in time to the beat of some music. She either forgot that she's not wearing panties or pants, or simply doesn't care that she's exposing herself so boldly.<br>
