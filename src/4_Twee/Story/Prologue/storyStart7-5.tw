Your slumber is punctuated by strange dreams and even stranger sensations. Your dreams seem to focus on growing different anatomy, or being in a different body. Occasionally you are forced to wake to a semi-conscious state due to thirst, hunger, or pain... but you're unable to distinguish these periods from your other dreams.
