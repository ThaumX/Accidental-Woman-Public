<<addtime 48>><<f y>>ou feel sudden burst of panic for no reason. The anxiety strikes you harder than ever, you feel so vulnerable, not-protected. Faces of people look hostile, you are surrounded by enemies! Paralyzed by fear you stuck on the place almost unable to move. In <<publicPrivacy>> you sweat and tremble, you want to cry out of horror but you can't make a single sound. They know, they will see you, they will arrest you. You can't think straight, your heart is trying to jump out of your chest...<br><br>
@@.mono;Please...I want this to end...please...@@
<br><br>
As time goes by you slowly, ever slowly regan control over your body and mind. After half an hour you feel safe enough to go out still covered with sweat and wiping tears from your face.<br><br>
@@.mono;It was so terrible... I don't want this happening to me any more... I was sure my heart would just stop beating at some moments...@@

The craving is terrible, almost unmanageable. You can't focus and your hands are riddled with constant nervous tics. It takes you a lot of efforts to regain at least some of the self-control.

You have no ide how did you manage to get to the place. It is very confusing but no matter how hard you try there is absolutely no memory about last hours. It takes you some time until you finally figure out where you are now.
