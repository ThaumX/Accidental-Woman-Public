@@.head3;Y@@ou are standing on the Appletree University campus. While called a university, the campus and facilities are actually on the small side. There is only a single coed dormitory building, and nearly all of the classrooms and administrative offices fit into three buildings. The buildings are all built with a modern architectural style containing a lot of glass, which gives the university something of a bohemian artistic atmosphere.

<<f y>>ou stumble upon some university students getting ready for their next class. You aren't sure if the vibrators are special for the course they're taking, or just general study equipment. What is clear, however, is that the university has a much more lax dress code than the town as a whole. Most of the female students are wearing little more than sandals.
