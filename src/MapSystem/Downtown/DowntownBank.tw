<<f y>>ou spend some time looking around, checking out the bank lobbies. Indigo Dragon is a bust, so you head over to Faust Bank. You notice that a couple of bank employees have started looking at you with a mixture of curiosity and concern, so you walk over to a brochure stand that contains information about the bank's products. Picking a couple that seem at least marginally interesting, you happen to notice some folded paper that looks out of place. <<link "Pick it up">><<pickup "$items" "Gene Therapy 04">><<run Dialog.close()>><<run UI.alert("You pick up the paper documents")>><</link>>.
