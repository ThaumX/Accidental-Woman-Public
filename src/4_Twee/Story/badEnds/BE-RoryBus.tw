    <p>You awaken to find yourself naked and strapped to a chair that resembles a gynecological exam chair. As your eyes adjust to the light and your vision clears, you see that you're in what looks to be a high-tech surgical theater, except that it's set in the corner of a cluttered basement. On one wall a bunch of tube socks are hanging next to photos of who you presume are their owners.
    </p>
    <p>
    A creepy child-woman lurches into your vision from the side. @@.npc;Ahh, you're awake, good!@@ She starts to pat your shoulder, as if trying to comfort you. @@.npc;I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but I've got some good news! You're going to help me grow up!@@ At some point her patting your shoulder transitioned into palpating your <<p breast.s>> breast, which really makes you doubt that her news is good.
    </p>
    <p>
    You start to ask @@.pc;Where am@@, but are interrupted by the crazy woman pushing her finger all over your lips. @@.npc;nuh huh, first we have to get you connected!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She pulls out what looks like a Fishy-Priapus toy from a cupboard, along with a set of two metal tubes with thin wires coming out of them. @@.npc;Don't worry, this is just my Energy Meter! I call it an E-Meter for short. It'll help keep your Thetan level nice and healthy!@@ She puts a metal tube against the palm of your hand, pushes your fingers closed around it, and then uses medical tape to keep it in place. She repeats the procedure for the other hand before plugging the wires into the plastic toy that has a simple meter on it along with a large twist knob power switch. After she clicks it on, and the meter needles starts bouncing around, she turns back to you. @@.npc;Okay, you can talk now!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    @@.pc;Where am I? What am I doing here?@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She looks at her toy and frowns. @@.npc;Oh dear, the E-Meter says you aren't quite ready for those questions yet...@@ She puts her hand to her chin as if miming that she's thinking about what to do. Her other hand is groping away at your inner thigh, which totally dispels whatever effect she was going for. @@.npc;I know! I'll tell you about my sock collection first!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She points over to the wall where the tube socks are hanging. @@.npc;When I was young, I saw this movie called American Pastry. Ever since I was fascinated by how boys would shoot their stuff inside.@@ You're relieved when her hand stops groping you as she walks over to the wall and pulls down a sock from the wall. It's hard as a rock, like it was dipped in a vat of glue and left to dry. @@.npc;When I got older, and I learned about my... medical problem... I got even more fascinated. So I started collecting these socks. Well used, of course!@@ She gives the sock she's holding a few swings through the air, demonstrating how solid it is. @@.npc;I still don't know how they keep using a sock when it's so hard like this, but that just adds to the mystery!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    You try to remain calm, realizing that this person is obviously crazy. @@.pc;I see... That is a mystery. Does that mean you can answer my questions now?@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She looks over at her "E-Meter" again for a while, and then her eyes light up. As far as you can tell, it's no different than when she looked the first time though... @@.npc;It seems like you're ready, so here goes!@@ She goes back to prodding your body in inappropriate places as she talks. @@.npc;I'm Rory, though I go by Misty online. This place here is my basement lab!@@ She pauses expectantly, waiting for you to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
    @@.pc;Oh, uhhhh, very impressive!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She smiles proudly as she pulls on your labia. @@.npc;Yep, I haven't worked at the Institute for all those years for nothing. I'm a six-year veteran of the services division, lead waste semen removal technician!@@ She pauses again, waiting.

    @@.pc;Oh, very impressive!@@

    She smiles and nods as her finger pokes around at random between your netherlips. @@.npc;As for why you're here, well, you see, I never really grew up.@@ She frowns dramatically. @@.npc;I never started puberty, so I still look like a little girl. There were medicines, but uncle Jimbob said they'd damage my thetan and give me engrams, so I never took them.@@ Her smile starts to return, as her finger moves down toward your rear entrance. @@.npc;But then I realized that if I could have the ovaries of a real girl at <i>just</i> the right point in development, like you, I could use them to supply the hormones and everything I need so I can finally grow up!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    You grimace, partly from realizing the implications of what she just said, and partly because one of her fingers pushed a small way into your asshole without lube. @@.pc;What do you mean "Have my ovaries"? I'm kind-of using them, you know?@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She looks at you with more than a little mania in her eyes as her finger pushes farther inside you. @@.npc;Don't be so selfish! You can take those drugs or have them regrown, you know?! They can't just regrow new ones for me, because <b><i>mine</i></b> don't work!@@ She pauses for a moment as she sees something happening on her plastic "E-Meter" toy. @@.npc;I'm sorry... It's just really important to me. Once I'm done with the procedure to harvest them, I'll let you go. I swear!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    @@.mono;Oh shit... well there's hope at least if she lets me go...@@ You try to stay calm. @@.pc;You promise you'll let me go? I won't say anything... You can have my ovaries or whatever, I just don't want to die!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She pulls her hand out, and gives you a thumbs up. Looking like she smelt something unpleasant, she sniffs her hand... and gives you a look like you just ripped ass in the middle of dinner. @@.npc;Don't worry, I really will let you go. Plus, third time's the charm, right?@@
    </p>
    <p>
    She drags a tray over with several scary surgical implements on it, and starts picking them up as if running a checklist with her unsanitary hands. @@.pc;Wait... what do you mean by "third time"?!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    she prods your abdomen a few times, as if feeling for something, and then picks up a used scalpel. @@.npc;Well, the first two times I wasn't able to get the ovaries out in time, and they got a little squished... I'm sure this time I can do it though!@@ She starts to push the scalpel to the skin of your abdomen, then looks at you in surprise. @@.npc;I'm sorry, I almost forgot!@@ She crumples up the sock she brought back earlier with audible crackling noises, and shoves it in your mouth. @@.npc;I don't want any engrams getting into your ovaries, so uncle Jimbob says I've gotta do this without giving you any medicine... Sorry about that. I gave you little Adam's sock instead, and he was quite a cutie!@@
    </p>
    <p>
    Without any further preparation, washing, or even putting on gloves, Rory starts cutting into your stomach. It doesn't take long before you pass out from the pain.
