:: guideConcept [nobr]

@@.head2;Concept@@<br>
In @@.hotpink;Accidental Woman@@ you play the part of a man temporarily trapped in the body of a woman. You have to live as a woman until your friend can transform you back. Along the way you can advance in your career, meet people, make friends, upgrade your home, get a boyfriend, and of course, have plenty of sex. Available actions for your character will depend on their personality and interactions thus far, and you will be forced to make choices along the way on how to live your accidental life. As with real life, reproduction is a serious concern. You can get pregnant, and you will meet NPCs that will try to knock you up, potentially with underhanded methods. Unlike real life, however, pregnancy can be shortened dramatically, and you won't have to worry about actually taking care of your children. (They will impact your available time each week though!) It's up to you to play the character of your choosing, perhaps an overly shy beauty, or an unattractive woman who wants nothing more than to be swept off her feet by prince charming.


:: guideColorCode [nobr]

@@.head2;Color Coding@@<br>
In order to make the details of the game easier, the text will use color coding to help identify whether something is good, bad, or significant. This can make gameplay faster for those who wish to focus on the ero parts of the game.<br>
<br>
@@.import;Yellow text@@ is used to denote something noteworthy.<br>
@@.ident;Bluegreen text@@ is used for names and identifiers.<br>
@@.head;Hot pink text@@ is used for headings and organization.<br>
@@.money;Yellow-green text@@ indicates a money-related event.<br>
@@.change;Gold text@@ means a change to your body, which could be good or bad.<br>
<br>
@@.good;Lime green text@@ means something good, like getting a promotion.<br>
@@.bad;Red text@@ means something bad, like being injured.<br>
@@.peepgood;Aquamarine text@@ means someone's perception of you has improved.<br>

<br>
@@.pc;Light red text@@ is used for the PC's speech.<br>
@@.npc;Light blue text@@ is used for NPC speech.<br>
@@.mono;Light red handwriting@@ is used for the PC's internal monologue.<br>



:: guideSidebar [nobr]

@@.head2;Side Bars (UI Bars)@@<br>
The side bar to the left gives access to some extra functions such as saving and loading. You can save or load the game at any point, though saving while the next scene is loading (generally the main window will be blank) such as processing the end of week changes to NPCs and relationships, is a bad idea! The arrow buttons will allow you to visit/reread previous passages and return to the current passage. Note that using links from a previous passage can cause unintended consequences, and usually does not actually undo a choice you've made. The side bar also displays some relevant information such as the day and time, your available credits, your location, and your status. @@.yellow;You can collapse the side bar@@ to increase the area of the main window. This is helpful for small screens such as cellphones. Finally, the side bar will allow you to access the @@.yellow;Contacts View@@, @@.yellow;Room View@@, and @@.yellow;Status View@@ menus. They show you information about the people you know and relationships, let you check out the relevant people in the room, and see your own status, respectively.



:: guideWeekplanner [nobr]

@@.head2;Week Planner and Summary@@<br>
Time in the game is based on individual @@.yellow;weeks@@. At the start of each week, you will use the week planner to choose your activities for the week. These plans aren't set in stone though, random events may interrupt what you've planned or force you to choose between your original plans or a new activity. When you aren't taking part in a social activity, you'll (usually) be free to move around your home or Appletree.<br><br>
@@.head3;Week Planner@@<br>
In the Week Planner, your primary task will be to choose weekly activities for the available time slots. During the week, much of your day will be occupied by work. Afternoons during the week can be used for several shorter activities such as shopping, cleaning, hanging out with friends, self improvement, or just relaxing. @@.import;(note that most activities will be accomplished by heading to the activity location on the map, which doesn't require planning! Activities, like dates, that require planning/coordination must be scheduled in the week planner.)@@ The weekend gives access to larger activities, and activities that involve staying out late such as going to a bar or club. From the Week Planner, you can also access your @@.yellow;wardrobe@@. Use the wardrobe to create outfits from available clothes based on the activity type. You can let the game choose an appropriate outfit for you, or select your own. <i>Note that choosing a very inappropriate outfit, such as an evening gown for working out at the gym, will likely cause some stares and potentially problems.</i> The Week Planner also gives you access to the @@.yellow;Home Menu@@, which allows you to manage your house's cleanliness, decoration, and also start shopping for a different home. You will also find the @@.yellow;Lifestyle Menu@@, which allows you to control things such as your luxury level for lifestyle expenses, your birth control, and things like medication and diet.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Week Summary@@<br>
The week summary gives you updates on what occured during the week, such as changes in relationships and finances. It also details information on your health (if something is wrong), pregnancy (if pregnant), your menstral cycle (if not pregnant), and children (if you have them). The Week Summary is important, but generally does not require any player input.


:: guideClothing [nobr]

@@.head2;Clothing and Outfits@@<br>
Rather than individually write hundreds of different clothing items, clothing is proceedurally generated to create numerous items. Clothing is broken up into categories based on where it is worn:<br>
''Headwear:'' Hats, masks, gags, blindfolds, and other novelty items. This category isn't terribly important.<br>
''Footwear:'' Shoes, basically. This game will undoubtedly underrepesent the variety of women's shoe fashion.<br>
''Legwear:'' Things worn on the legs such as stockings and pantyhose. (No effect if wearing long pants!)<br>
''Lower Body:'' Lower clothes such as pants and skirts.<br>
''Upper Body:'' Tops such as blouses, as well as dresses.<br>
''Overwear:'' Items like a sweater, business jacket, or accent pieces.<br>
''Panties:'' Underwear such as briefs, thongs, and others.<br>
''Bras:'' Different kinds of breast coverings.<br><br>
Clothing for each category can have one of many possible styles (button-up blouse, blouse, teeshirt, tank top, etc.) and several modifying traits such as color/patern, cut, transparency, etc. These are used to determine the stats of the resulting clothing item. The general stats are: Overall Attractiveness, Sexiness or Cuteness, Casual or Elegant, and Exposure. Sexy clothes tend to be suggestive, and conflicts with cuteness. Sexyness and Exposure are related, but not necessarily the same. Exposure rates how exposed your groin or breasts are while wearing the garment. Additionally, exposure is determined cumulatively. Your exposure will be low, for example, despite wearing no bra and a transparent top if you are wearing a pullover sweater with low exposure over it.
<br><br>
Different clothing items can be selected to form an outfit. Outfits can then be assigned to different categories of activities. The activities are Casual, Dressed-Up, Athletic, Business, Around-the-House, Sleepwear, and Sexy. You can flag an outfit to multiple activities, being flagged for an activity makes it available to be randomly chosen for that type of activity. You can also flag an outfit as 'Primary', which makes it available for quick select in the Week Planner. Otherwise, you can choose any outfit using the select outfit link for individual activities.


:: guideInteract [nobr]

@@.head2;Interaction@@<br>
After finishing the opening portion of the game, interaction all takes place using action links. Below the story text, you will be presented with a list of one or more possible actions for you to take. To the right of the action links will be text describing the action in more detail. By using action links, you will choose how you interact with people and other decisions throughout the game.


:: guideRelationships [nobr]

@@.head2;Relationships@@<br>
Your character will build relationships with the NPCs they meet over the course of the game. They can make friends, friends with benefits, lovers, and boyfriends. Relationships are intended to be quite flexible, and based upon your actions. Additionally, you will not be forced into an exclusive relationship; players can have multiple lovers if they so choose. However, if they do form an exclusive relationship with an NPC, there is a chance of your boyfriend finding out about infidelity.
<br><br>
The most important aspect to relationships in Accidental Woman is that they are not static. With the exception of certain special NPCs such as Lily, relationship strength will naturally decay over time if you don't interact with the NPCs you have a relationship with. There are multiple ways to hang out with NPCs, usually depending on the type of relationship involved. The @@import;Spend Time@@ activity allows you to maintain or improve your relationship with an NPC without spending much player time on the activity. Spend Time will not improve a relationship very much, but does prevent a relationship from decaying. When spending time, you can choose to spend time with multiple friends at the same time. In these cases, the benefit will be spread amongst the relationships involved, and will be affected by how well the different NPCs get along. 


:: guideCheats [nobr]

@@.head2;Cheats and Cheat Mode@@<br>
There are several cheats available to alter your play experience or allow you to focus on a particular aspect of play that you like. It should be noted that using cheats can make the game overly simplistic, particularly if you use several of them. Cheats are generally restricted to Patreon backers to reward their support. There are two types of cheats in the game. The first are cheats that are enabled at game start, and usually have a one-time effect such as increasing starting money. The other is Cheat Mode, which operates through the game and adds potential effects that can be toggled on or off for the week, such as removing relationship decay.

Having a skill over 100 indicates increasing ability, but also has diminishing returns. Each new point in a skill above 100 has less of an impact than the last.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td width=20%>@@.head3;Sex Skill@@</td><td>Generic skill covering your ability to perform in bed (or elsewhere). Important for determining your partner's satisfaction/enjoyment of sex. <i>Improved by having sex, particularly in varied positions and situations.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Oral Skill@@</td><td>Determines your skill at giving oral pleasure, and also impacts your ability to use your hands. Important if you want to successfully give a blowjob; a low skill makes it more likely that your partner will interupt you. Also important for oral at the gloryhole. <i>Improved by giving oral.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Exhibitionism@@</td><td>Rather than a standard skill, this is more about the level of exhibitionism you're willing to do, and the situations you're willing to do it in. It also governs how effective you are at making it alluring, and your ability to get away with it in very public places. <i>Learned by exhibitionist behavior.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Prostitution@@</td><td>Your ability to perform the oldest profession. This skill relates to several aspects of prostitution, and combined with your sex and oral skills will determine your client's satisfaction and your profit. <i>Learned during the course of prostitution.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td>@@.head3;Aesthetics@@</td><td>A general sense related to understanding what looks good that is involved in a wide range of areas from home decor to style and fashion. <i>Improved by learning: reading magazines, design books, visiting a museum, and other activities.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Athletics@@</td><td>Your overall fitness, endurance, flexibility, and general athletic ability. This is one of the few skills that will decline if not used regularly, though there are plenty of opportunities to use it (the gym, sex, dancing, etc). Reduces the likelyhood of illness, and makes it possible to have more sex in more ways. <i>Improved by working out and with vigorous sex.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Dancing@@</td><td>A skill pretty much only useful on the dance floor, having a high level in this skill does improve your appearance on the dance floor. It also lets you do some rather naughty things while obstensibly only dancing. <i>Improved by dancing and taking lessons.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Cleaning@@</td><td>An overlooked but important skill, your cleaning skill determines your ability to clean your residence. This impacts how much cleaning you get done in one action, and the level of cleanliness you can achieve. Many potential partners won't want to stay long if your place is filthy. <i>Improved by spending more time cleaning.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Shopping@@</td><td>Your ability to find the items you want, and to get them at a better price. This impacts all the shopping activities, such as buying clothes or home items, and also affects your living expenses. <i>Improved by shopping.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>@@.head3;Cooking@@</td><td>Your ability to make food. Even a low skill can make an acceptable meal, but a high skill means that you can make gourmet food with less time and stress. <i>Improved by study and taking classes, as well as by practice.</i></td></tr>

<br>''Twine Sugarcube'' For providing the engine used by this game to everyone free of charge.
<br>''Trap Quest'' For demonstrating how fun/replayable an erotic game can be with proper game design elements.
<br>''Girl's Life'' From which this game heavily draws inspiration for the scope possible with erotic life simulation games.
<br>''New Life'',  For inspiring a different take on life simulation mechanics (namely choosing weekly activities) that inspired the hybrid approach of Accidental Woman to give more control to the player while removing some of more open life sims.

:: guideAbout [nobr]

@@.head1;About the Game@@<br><br>
@@.head3;Accidental Woman@@ is an interactive fiction life sim game for adults. It's built in Twine Sugarcube, and can be played on most OSes and smartphones. In the game, you take the role of a recently single and unemployed man who takes the offer of a longtime friend to move to the secluded town of Appletree. Due to an unfortunate accident, you find yourself completely transformed into a woman, and will have to deal with far more than just transitioning to small-town life!
<br><br>
Get the latest public version, see development news, and get more info at the [[Dev Blog|https://www.thaumx.com/]]. And of course, any [[support|https://www.patreon.com/thaumx]] is greatly appreciated!
<br><br>
@@.head2;Different by Design@@<br>
Accidental Woman provides a unique combination of game elements, having the many options and open-world play of a life sim game, but also including rich fiction and numerous plot threads throughout. It features high-quality erotic writing that is written to accommodate the uniqueness of the PC and NPCs, while still allowing control of individual actions in an encounter. The game also features a detailed NPC generator (along with player customization of the generator) and will have an NPC editor that allows players to create custom NPCs to populate Appletree.
<br><br>
The game takes a blended approach to NPCs, with only a few 'fixed' NPCs that stay the same from play-through to play-through. Many of the supporting characters use a blend of fixed and random attributes and stories. The majority of Appletree's people are made up of random generated NPC characters. Unlike most life sim games, however, generated NPCs use a story thread system. The story threads are composed of several elements that are randomly combined into unique stories. These inform the character's behavior and personality, and provide depth to NPCs that are typically only differentiated by appearance and a few personality archetypes in other games.
<br><br>
The idea is to create a life sim game that allows a lot of variety and control over the player character in a richly-detailed world, while providing plenty of opportunities for players to experiment, explore, and challenge themselves with different player characters.
<br><br>
@@.head2;Welcome to Appletree@@<br>
A relatively new town nestled in a small valley and surrounded by old-wood forests, Applewood is a planned community that was build to give employees of the Institute a place to live. Clean and beautiful, Appletree is a paradoxical town that manages to be both idyllic and active at the same time. No matter where you look at the town's calmly refined exterior, there's always something strange, exciting, or both hidden just under the surface. It's probably thanks to the unique people who live there; the scientists, engineers, and other employees who work for the institute.
<br><br>
@@.head2;Game Play@@<br>
Players will build relationships and maintain them, and access erotic content within (or outside!) the relationships they've built. By controlling the creation of the player character, and the NPCs that inhabit the world, players can experience numerous scenarios. Perhaps a PC that doesn't want kids, in a world inhabited by NPCs that really want to impregnate her. Maybe a PC who becomes addicted to orgies or cum, or a PC determined to live the high life by becoming a high-class prostitute. A PC may even decide to be a gold digger, dating a wealthy man for his money, while trying to keep her infidelity secret because her boyfriend can't or won't satisfy her. The idea with Accidental Woman is to create a game that makes all these stories--and many more--possible inside an organic simulation.
<br><br>
In the middle of all this, players will struggle with employment and managing their character's life from fashion and home decor to friendship and mental health. Players can guide their character to outstanding success, or watch them devolve into a sex addict with a drug problem. Along the way, they'll deal with the unique circumstances surrounding Appletree, the Institute, and their own Transformation.

<br>''Change''--Lets you modify the clothes that you are wearing. You can put-on or take-off individual garments, select an outfit to wear, or simply get naked.
<br>''Outfits''--Lets you view your current saved outfits in detail (including combined stats). It also allows you to modify or delete your outfits. You'll need to have outfits ready for planned activities like going to work or going on a date, but you're free to modify them up until the activity begins.
<br>''Create''--This menu is specifically for creating new outfits. Outfits are important for planned activities. (To avoid having to get dressed everytime you go to work, for example!) If you're playing a new game, you should create at least 1 outfit by the end of the Prologue!
<br>''Inventory''--Lets you examine the clothes that you own individually, and also lets you get rid of clothes you no longer want.


:: guideGrooming [nobr]

The Grooming Menu is where you can control the finer points of your appearance. Some of these options are purely customization for personal preference, while others like makeup and hairstyle have more of an impact on your attractiveness. While body hair is generally in the personal preference category, and ThaumX makes no judgement personally about what people choose to do with their hair, visible leg/underarm hair ''will'' have a minor negative effect on your attractiveness stat because of the social mores in North America.
<br>''Hair''--This is where you can change your hairstyle and your hairstyle presets. You can also see which hair styles you have learned.
<br>''Face''--This is essentially makeup, because Face fit better into the button than Makeup did. You'll be able to change makeup here, as well as your makeup presets. You can also practice and learn new makeup styles in front of the mirror, and control any face-based grooming regimines.
<br>''Wear''--This is where you control the jewelry that you wear. Menstral products are worn automatically, and accessories are controlled in the wardrobe menu. This menu <i>may</i> be expanded with a wider range of style/decoration-based wearables in the future.
<br>''Other''--This is where you control all the other stuff! Actually, this page mainly deals with body hair, pubic hair styling, and brushing your teeth.


:: guideClothingGen [nobr]


@@.head3;Clothing Generator@@
<br><br>
The clothing generator consists of a function (twine: widget) for each clothing type. I have built the functions with 6 arguments to allow easy customization of the clothing selection, so that different stores can pass different arguments and easily have differentiated clothing selections without needing multiple clothing generators.<br><br>
@@.head3;<<-"Arguments:">>@@<br>

@@.head4;<<-"1:">>@@ ''Style'' - An argument that sets the available styles, and the relative odds of encountering those styles. (The odds will likely need tuning in the future.) A store can sell very sexy or fetish styles exclusively, or predominantly conservative clothing, based on this setting. Potential substyles are based on the style.<br>
@@.head4;<<-"2:">>@@ ''Fabric'' - An argument that sets the available fabrics, and the relative odds of those fabrics, which is further based on the actual style/substyle of the garment so far. Functions similar to Style, and controls how sexy/sheer/etc a garment's fabric can be.<br>
@@.head4;<<-"3:">>@@ ''Color'' - A setting that allows control over the types of colors available for a garment. Could be set to more formal colors, or for cute colors, etc.<br>
@@.head4;<<-"4:">>@@ ''Quality'' - A simple setting that allows modification of the clothing's overall attractiveness (and potentially sexiness/cuteness in the future) This lets us differentiate between stores that are lower-end or more generic, and stores that are expensive and fashionable.<br>
@@.head4;<<-"5:">>@@ ''Name'' - Sets the name of the store into the clothing array, which can be used in several ways in addition to reminding a player where they bought a certain clothing item.


:: guideClothingStats [nobr]

@@.head3;Clothing Stats@@<br><br>
The stats or attributes of a piece of clothing are based on its style, substyle, fabric, and to a lesser degree color. However, these stats are not always the same. The style, substyle, fabric, and color do not add or subtract a fixed amount from clothing stat values. Instead, each has a weighted random range of values to add or subtract. This means that two otherwise identical clothing items are very unlikely to have the same stats. This mimics clothing in real life, where small differences in style/design impact how good it looks. (Basically, not all black satin demi-cup bras look the same.)
<br><br>
The price of clothing is based on the type of clothing and its attributes, and there is a multiplier to change the price based on the store. Pricing is done outside the clothing generator to allow for things like sales. Currently, there is no randomness in the price of clothing, it is entirely deterministic.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Anatomy of a Clothing Variable@@<br>
Each clothing item--except for bags/purses and accessories--has 11 values in its array when created, and then 12 when purchased. (The 12th being the purchase price.) This gives us rich information about the clothing that can be used during play in a number of ways.
<br>@@.head4;Example@@<br>
@@.ident;Some Bra @@ <<-"[">>@@.note;String-Name of Bra, Attractiveness, Cuteness/Sexyness, Casual/Formal, Exposure, Status, Style #, Substyle #, Fabric #, Store String, Price@@<<-"]">>
<br><br>
The most interesting to you is likely @@.exp;Exposure@@ and @@.exp;Status@@.<br><br>
@@.head3;Exposure@@ is a numerical value representing how exposed relevant body parts are. In the case of a bras, blouses, and overwear, this is how exposed the breasts are. The scale goes from 0-completely covered, to 5-completely exposed. The areas inbetween allow for different levels of exposure. a low value may allow people to detect hard nipples, while a high value may be thin and sheer so that it hardly hides anything. Exposure is also affected by the "protection" a garment gives. An ultrasheer shirt may allow you to see everything, but wouldn't let you touch it directly, so doesn't have an exposure value of 5. In addition, exposure works based on the cumulative level of exposure for all the garments covering that part of the body. You can be wearing a cupless bra, and a tranparent latex shirt, but your exposure level would still be extremely low if you were wearing a sweatshirt over those. (Unless you pulled the sweatshirt off, or hiked it up over your chest.)<br><br>
@@.head3;Status@@ is a coded value, and is probably the neatest or most original mechanic when it comes to clothes in AW. Each clothing item has a range of possible status values based on the style, substyle, and fabric values. The status of a garment affects its primary stats. For example, a thin cotton tee-shirt would normally have a relatively-low exposure value, but could have that modified to be higher by being wet. A skirt could be hiked up, a shirt could be unbuttoned, panties can be pulled aside, or jeans could be unbuttoned, unzipped, and worn quite low. The value is coded to allow multiple status effects at the same time, such as being wet, torn, and unfastened all at once.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Cuteness/Sexiness@@ is a numerical value representing how cute or sexy a clothing item is. While it doesn't affect attractiveness strongly, it does have an impact on the perception of NPCs, along with your chosen persona and other factors.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Formality@@ is a representation of how "formal" a clothing item is. Some clothing items are extremely casual, and would only be worn around the house, while others are very formal and wouldn't be very appropriate for a casual get-together.

:: guideWeight [nobr]

@@.head3;Weight Information@@<br><br>
Weight information in Accidental Woman is based on the Body Mass Index, or BMI. You can read more about [[BMI here|https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html]]. While BMI isn't a particularly accurate system for determining the 'fatness' of someone, it is useful as a general approximation because it includes height in addition to weight.<br><br><table><tr class="divide"><td colspan=3><h3>AW Weight Appearance to BMI</h3></td></tr><tr><td width="40%">''Weight Description''</td><td width="35%">''BMI Range''</td><td>'' Variable Value''^^note^^</td></tr><tr><td>Anorexic</td><td>less than 18</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Skinny</td><td>less than 20</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Normal/Lithe</td><td>20 to 22.5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Heavyset/Plush</td><td>22.5 to 25</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Chubby</td><td>more than 25</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Fat</td><td>more than 27.5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Obese</td><td>more than 30</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Very Obese</td><td>more than 32.5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Morbidly Obese</td><td>more than 35</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>@@.note;Note that the listed variable value refers only to appearance, and not the actual weight of the character, which is handled seperately.@@</td></tr></table><br><br>These standards are based on medical information, and thus don't represent the full range of possibilities at different BMI levels. It's also not intended as a value statement about people's weight. Weight (and losing it) is a challenging topic that is beyond the scope of this game. In addition, normal is just a descriptive word, and doesn't indicate actual normality.<br><br>Male and female weight labels differ on values 3 and 4 because of differences in anatomy and cultural appearance standards. Both levels are within the healthy 'appropriate weight' range. ''Value 3''' indicates a low enough weight that muscle definition is easily visible, such as well-formed 'six-pack' abs. For women this is an athletic/lithe look, though because it emphasizes muscles the appearance changes dramatically with the amount of muscle mass. Interestingly enough, medical research has found this weight to be unhealthy in the long term, with higher mortality and incidence of disease. ''Value 4'' indicates a more natural amount of body fat. In males this amount of fat obscures muscle somewhat, making a clearly defined 'six-pack' difficult. In women this is the amount of fat needed for a smooth, curvy appearance, and is the most traditionally beautiful. Think soft, rather than pudgy, and you'll be on the right track.

:: guideHeight [nobr]

@@.head3;Height Information@@
<br><br>
Height information in Accidental Woman is based on statistical medical data for the United States. While using percentiles of height might not always match people's perception of what is 'very tall' or 'very short', it is more useful to base height standards on this information. This is because setting very tall and very short to higher and lower values respectively would result in very few NPCs fitting into that category, and making the preference generally useless. NPCs are generated with statistical distributions mirroring real life. Because of this, extreme values are rarely encountered.
<br><br>
Additionally, I am using the distribution for white people. This is because it is relatively average, and relates well to distributions in other countries. The African American distribution is actually very similar to the white distribution, in fact slightly shorter on average, but stretches much higher at the extreme tall end of the spectrum. (0.1 percentile). Anyways, please don't take this as a racist perspective. I may add support or patches for editing these values much later in development.

The muscle descriptions (often called "tone") in Accidental Woman are primarily representitive of the size of muscles, rather than the strength of muscles.

''Extroverted:'' extroverted people usually enjoy social situations, and are less likely to suffer negative effects from stress. Conversely, they tend to be less intelligent and have a high dependence on others for happiness and self-worth.<i>You will find it easier to build and maintain relationships, but will be more dependant on them and need more.</i>

''Weak:'' Having weak willpower will make you more susceptable to temptation, particularly when under the influence, and make it more difficult to force yourself to do unpleasant tasks. You are more susceptable to addiction as well.
<br><br>
''Normal:'' You have normal willpower, but in intense moments or when under stress you may find yourself more willing to give in to temptation or avoid unpleasant chores.
<br><br>
''Strong:'' Having strong willpower will allow you to resist temptation easier. You will find it easier to diet and force yourself to do unpleasant tasks, or not partake in temptations.

:: guideMinorTraits [nobr]

@@.head4;Minor Personality Traits@@
<br><br>
Each trait has an opposite trait that is excluded when it is chosen. You can't be both caring and uncaring at the same time. Choosing neither trait means that you fall somewhere between them, a more normal or average position. Some of these traits are negative with no real advantage besides potential extra content, but can serve as a handicap or as an aid to roleplay.
<br><br>
''Caring/Uncaring:'' A caring person is likely to be more empathetic, and more likely to be bothered by other people's problems. An uncaring person isn't overly bothered by the misfortune of others.
<br><br>
''Bitch/Kind:'' A bitch is more likely to stand up for herself, but also can be harsh and annoying to people. A Kind person is more likely to get along with others, but also more likely to be taken advantage of.
<br><br>
''Maternal/Bad With Kids:'' A maternal person has a natural ability with children, and finds taking care of them easier. Someone who is bad with kids is the opposite of this, and seems to have a hard time dealing with children.
<br><br>
''Romantic/Aromantic:'' A romantic person falls in love easier, but is also affected more strongly by breakups and relationships. An aromantic person finds it difficult to fall in love, but does not suffer many negative effects from failing romantic relationships.
<br><br>
''Deceptive/Honest:'' A deceptive person is naturally good at lying, and can use deception more effectively (for good or bad). An honest person is bad at lying, and will likely be seen to be more trustworthy, but will also find it difficult to be dishonest when neccessary.
<br><br>
''Devious/Straight-Forward:'' A devious or Machivellian person is more likely to be manipulative to achieve her objectives, though can also devise schemes that end up benefiting everyone. A devious person is also better at recognizing the motives and schemes of others. A straight-forward person seems easier to deal with, and often times can be seen as more likeable or trustworthy. They also have a hard time recognizing the deception and schemes of others.
<br><br>
''Persuasive/Follower:'' A persuasive person is able to convince others to go along with their wishes, though this can have a negative effect on relationships if they always get their way. A follower is a person who is easily influenced, and goes along with the wishes and actions of others. This rarely hurts a relationship, but also means that they are more likely to be pushed toward an action they don't want to take.
<br><br>
''Perceptive/Oblivious:'' A perceptive person pays more attention to details and is more likely to spot something unusual or notice when something is wrong. An oblivious person is the opposite, remaining largely blind to details and problems. They do say, however, that ignorance is bliss.
<br><br>
''Forgetful/Good Memory:'' A pretty simple trait, a forgetful person is more likely to forget something important, while a person with a good memory is more likely to remember important tasks. Memory relates much more to non-routine tasks like appointments or work activities than it does to routine tasks like taking medication each day.
<br><br>
''Low Self-Esteem/Narcissistic:'' A person with low self-esteem doesn't view themselves as very valuable. They are more prone to negative mental effects, and more likely to find themselves stuck in a bad relationship. A narcissistic person values themselves too much, and can have trouble forming strong relationships, romantic or otherwise, with other people.
<br><br>
''Forgiving/Holds Grudges:'' A forgiving person is more likely to forgive mistakes or malicious actions of others, and can avoid a lot of negative emotional effects. They are also more likely to be hurt repeatedly. A person who holds grudges has a hard time forgiving, and can have excessive negative emotional consequences from betrayal. They are unlikely to be hurt repeatedly.
<br><br>
''Picky/Low Standards:'' A picky person has very high standards, and can have difficulty meeting people that are 'good enough' for them. A person with low standards finds people more attractive on average, but also can end up settling when they could do better.
<br><br>
''Crude/Refined:'' A crude person is less aware of mannors and social mores, and some people can find them rude or offensive. They are unlikely to be put off by natural bodily functions or other crude people. Refined people have a good understanding or mannors and politeness, but are easily upset by crude behavior.
<br><br>
''Friendly/Unfriendly:'' A friendly person finds it easier to start and strengthen relationships with people, but can also be seen as being fake or less genuine by some. An unfriendly person finds it harder to start and strengthen relationships, but is also seen to be more genuine and honest when it comes to relationships.
<br><br>
''Approachable/Unapproachable:'' An approachable person has a certain appearance that makes them seem safer to start a conversation with. They are more likely to be hit on, and often valued more, but conversely have to deal with unwanted advances. Unapproachable is essentially the opposite.
<br><br>
''Relaxed/Ambitious:'' A relaxed person is generally happy with their place in life, and is unlikely to receive much stress from work or financial matters. An ambitious person is more likely to succeed financially, but also deals with greater stress in this area.
<br><br>
''Materialistic/Hippy:'' A materialistic person really appreciates the finer things in life, and gains more benefit from having luxuries. They also are more greatly affected by not having luxuries. A hippy gains little benefit from luxury, but also doesn't lose much from poorer conditions.
<br><br>
''Flirty/Shy:'' A flirty person is naturally flirty and intimate, and is good at encouraging a romantic interest to make a move. A shy person has a hard time opening themselves up with new people, sometimes giving a romantic interest the impression that they aren't interested.


:: guideKinks [nobr]

@@.head3;Sexual Kinks@@
<br><br>
''Oral:'' Enjoys giving oral sex, or is at least willing to do so. Unchecking this box indicates that you dislike giving oral sex, and will never offer it yourself. This doesn't mean that a partner won't 'strongly encourage' you to go down on them.
<br><br>
''Bare Sex:'' You really enjoy bare and/or risky sex, and like the feeling of receiving a creampie. You will find sex that ends in a creampie (whether accidental or intentional) to be more fullfilling. This doesn't include an urge to get pregnant, just a certain amount of risk, and you'll still want partners to pull out or use condom on risky days. This will not remove your worry about potential pregnancy or disease if applicable.
<br><br>
''Cumslut:'' More than simply liking oral sex, you have a strong like of semen. You will find it easier to perform intense oral, and will receive satisfaction from swallowing semen and other acts involving cum. You tend to find larger balls more attractive.
<br><br>
''Submissive:'' You are naturally submissive, and dislike taking the lead in sexual encounters. This will limit some sexual activities, but you will find aggressive partners more satisfying.
<br><br>
''Easy to Please:'' You are more sensitive than normal, and you find it easier than average to achieve orgasm (and multiple orgasms).
<br><br>
''Anal:'' Enjoys anal sex, or is at least willing to have it. Unchecking this box indicates that you dislike anal sex, and will never offer it yourself. This doesn't mean that a partner won't try, or that you won't get surprise buttsex.
<br><br>
''Pregnancy:'' You are strongly aroused by pregnancy and the concept of breeding. Unlike simply liking bare sex, you are far more likely to seek and engage in pregnancy-risk sex, and if the two are combined may even be willing to circumvent your partner's attempts at birth control to enjoy risky sex. You do not suffer worry about potential pregnancy, but can still become worried about disease if applicable. You tend to find large testicles more attractive.
<br><br>
''Size Queen:'' You have an obsession with large cocks, finding them much more attractive than normal, and have a dislike of average to small cocks. You will find sex with average equipment less satisfying and less likely to get you off, but will have little difficulty handling large equipment.
<br><br>
''Dominant Streak:'' You have a natural preference or aptitude for being dominant. This doesn't instantly make you a masterful dom as soon as you find a sub partner though.
<br><br>
''Sensitive Nipples:'' Your nipples are more sensitive than normal, and you find it <b>far</b> easier to orgasm from nipple play. You also get a lot more enjoyment out of general breast play and activities like tit fucking.
<br><br>
''Forced:'' The most popular female fantasy based on empirical research, and the subject of most novels of the romance genre, forced is when you are forced into a sexual situation ranging from a kiss to full intercourse. Unchecking this box indicates that you are completely opposed to any forced situations, even with a loving partner and/or via roleplay.
<br><br>
''Exhibitionist:'' You enjoy the thrill of exhibitionism, and are more willing to wear revealing clothes in public. Your Exhibitionism skill will increase more rapidly, but so will your arousal from exhibitionism.
<br><br>
''Buttslut:'' A more extreme version of likes anal, you really enjoy anal sex. You recieve significantly more satisfaction from anal, but will be unhappy with a partner that isn't willing to have anal frequently enough.
<br><br>
''Bondage:'' You find bondage activity enjoyable, or are at least willing to participate. This acts as a 'soft gate' to bondage content. Not checking this box won't eliminate content with light or minor bondage, but will avoid more intense bondage play.
<br><br>
''Rape Fetish:'' You have strong fantasies about hardcore rape. Sexual assault and rape is unlikely to harm you much mentally, but you are also more likely to encounter such situations due to risky behavior tied to this fetish.
<br><br>
''Watersports:''Enjoys watersports (pee), or is at least willing to participate. Unchecking this box indicates that you dislike watersports, and will never get involved voluntarily.
<br><br>
''Public Sex:'' You really enjoy sexual activity in public, finding it far more thrilling than normal. You get a lot more satisfaction than normal from sex in public. You also find it difficult to resist temptation in a public setting.
<br><br>
''Liberated:'' You realize that sex doesn't have to be connected to love and relationships, and find satisfaction in casual sex. This also means that you don't have any problem with prostitution, and you tend to enjoy the activity more. Your prostitution skill will increase more rapidly, though your attitutes may be a turn off to some NPCs of a romantic persuasion.
<br><br>
''Masochist:'' You enjoy pain, and find it sexually arousing. At this time, this doesnt' do much. <i>If more content is desirable it can be added, but it's a little outside my ability to write effectively. I've done some experimentation personally, but it wasn't for me. I just can't wrap my head around it well enough to write it.</i>
<br><br>
''Slut:'' You ''LOVE'' sex, and are basically willing to do anything. You get a ''lot'' more satisfaction from extreme sex and activities like orgies and gloryholes, and have no problem with prostitution. You start high on the 'sex addiction' stat and gain it quicker, but also suffer less from humiliation and other negative social input. You can cure a bad day at the office easily, if you can avoid nymphomania. ''Warning--Choosing this trait automatically enables some other "okay" traits! (oral, anal, force, bondage, exhibition)'' <i>Characters who follow the path of sexual hedonism will eventually find this trait added later, and eventually the 'Superslut' trait. Your starting libido will also be quite high.</i>
<br><br>
''Hard to Please:'' It's more difficult than normal for you to reach orgasm. <i>This makes it harder to keep yourself satisfied.</i>
<br><br>
''Fapper:'' You really enjoy a good fap, and get a little more satisfaction from it. Your expert touch has made normal encounters less pleasurable, and you find normal sex less satisfying.
<br><br>
''Shamefast:'' For whatever reason, you find sexual activities to be shameful or wrong. You never really let yourself enjoy it, so sexual activities of all kinds are less satisfying. Additionally, you have feelings of guilt afterwards, so are usually less happy after giving in to your urges. ''This is not easy.''

@@.head3;Female Mutations@@
<br><br>
''Hypermilky:'' This mutation causes your pituitary gland to constantly produce prolactin, meaning that you lactate all the time. It's like Prolactinoma, but without the brain tumor! If you get pregnant, you will end up producing a huge amount of milk. <i>This mutation affects breast size.</i>
<br><br>
''Vaginal Enzymes:'' Your Bartholin glands (two large-pea-sized glands that produce vaginal lubrication) secrete an extra enzyme called Rubber Oxygenase (RoxA) that allows cleavage and oxygenation of several rubber polymers including latex. Exposure to this enzyme rapidly degrades the structural integrity of condoms. The longer a condom is exposed to your lubrication (including pre-intercourse activities), the greater the likelyhood that it will shred during intercourse or break upon ejaculation. <i>This mutation significatly affects condom effectiveness, but in a manageable way. Sex that finishes quickly without female orgasm has only a small chance of breakage, while long-duration sex will almost certainly result in the condom shredding.</i>
<br><br>
''Abnormal Hormones:'' Your endocrine system is unusual, particularly in regard to gonadotropins, resulting in less effective chemical birth control. Birth control pills, patches, and implants have a much greater chance of being ineffective each cycle. <i>Increases odds from 2-4% to 15-30% depending on method. Failed birth control still requires impregnation & implantation check for pregnancy.</i>
<br><br>
''Multiple Ovulation:'' You have a very high chance to ovulate multiple eggs at once when you ovulate, allowing for fraternal twins, potentially with different fathers. <i>odds are determined by fertility. An ultra-fertile character could potentially have quadruplets.</i>
<br><br>
''Rapid Gestation:'' Your body for some reason gestates babies extremely quickly, reducing the total pregnancy duration to only 6 weeks without further intervention.
<br><br>
''Hyper Ovulatory Phase:'' Your menstral cycle is tuned for fertility. You have an extended ovulatory phase during your menstral cycle that causes you to ovulate multiple times after your first ovulation. This causes your period to be especially brief, your highly-fertile period is greatly expanded, and you are more fertile than normal during the other portions of your cycle. <i>Combining this with Multiple Ovulation could result in some [[interesting|http://i.imgur.com/wD8sPmx.jpg]] results.</i>
<br><br>
''Twin Wombs:'' You have two fully-formed and functional wombs, complete with two cervixes and two sets of ovaries. Your second womb is in the reversed anterior position. This allows you to have two pregnancies at once. <i>For right now, the second womb only becomes viable once the first is already pregnant. This could be changed depending on feedback.</i>
<br><br>
''Vulva Pheromones:'' You secrete pheromones from your vulva that puts men into an animalistic rut. Men who have been exposed are unlikely to take no for an answer, even if they are normally considerate and respectful. This also includes considerations such as wearing a condom or pulling out. You will have to protect your groin until you are ready for sex.
<br><br>
''Ethanol Immunity:'' With the worst luck ever, you somehow ended up completely immune to the imparement caused by alcohol. You will not suffer intoxication, but also will not get any benefit from consuming alcohol. <i>Warning: you can still die from alcohol poisoning</i>
<br><br>
''Salivary Enzymes:'' The salivary glands in your mouth secrete an extra enzyme called Rubber Oxygenase (RoxA) that allows cleavage and oxygenation of several rubber polymers including latex. Exposure to this enzyme rapidly degrades the structural integrity of condoms. The longer a condom is exposed to your mouth, the greater the likelyhood that it will fail.
<br><br>
''Contortionist:'' You must have had circus performers in your ancestry. You're able to get yourself into slightly kinkier sex positions, and you suffer far fewer health consequences from long-term or extreme bondage. There may also be a few obscure situations where you could benefit from your increased flexibility.
<br><br>
''Alluring Pheromones:'' A throwback to animal ancestors, you naturally produce pheromones in your sweat glands. These pheromones make you more attractive to males until they become accustomed to them over time. These pheromones have the opposite effect on females, provoking competitive urges in them.
<br><br>
''Elastic Orifices:'' Your orifices are less prone to injury from being stretched, less likely to become permanently stretched, and have are more likely to recover from temporary stretching. <<helpPop "Gaping" "Vaginal and anal stretching are modeled more realistically in Accidental Woman than in many games. Stretching is broken into two categories: temporary and permanent. Temporary stretching results from relatively normal activities, and is reduced over time with a doubling counter. Extreme activities can result in permanent stretching, and a large buildup of temporary stretching has a chance for some to become permanent. Permanent stretching never recovers except with the Elastic Orifices mutation. A game setting exists that will mitigate this for those who do not wish to have stretched orifices.">>
<br><br>
''Pseudo-Pregnancy:'' Your body has a strange reaction to <i>unusual</i> genetic material. An immune response results in a non-viable embryonic cyst that causes many of the symptoms of pregnancy. Eventually the cyst is rejected by the body and must be expelled.
<br><br>
''Amenorrhea:'' The unusual nature of your feminization resulted in you having Amenorrhea, which is the medical term for not having a period. This mutation means that you do not normally have a period. This has only a small effect on your fertility when ovulating, but does mean that you ovulate less frequently. It also means that it is impossible for you to tell when your "dangerous" days are.
<br><br>
''Lilith's Porphyria:'' Limited parts of your body's metabolic processes have been damaged, resulting in an inability to produce certain chemicals and metabolites necessary to survive. One of these is the specific iron compound called heme, which is necessary for your blood to carry oxygen. In the case of Lilith's Porphyria, this metabolic fault is the result of being unable to produce certain <i>other</i> complex metabolites.

@@.head3;M@@uch has changed in the intervening years between now and 2029. While most changes won't be directly mentioned, they do form a strong undercurrent that influences how people act. Here are some of the major changes:
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>The steady march of <<link "automation">><<replace "#youtubers">><iframe width="90%"  height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Pq-S557XQU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><</replace>><</link>> has caused tremendous levels of unemployment, though the situation is more optimistic than the realistic projections. The social support for the unemployed is less than ideal, particularly in the United States, but has managed to stave off the collapse of the economy.
<span id="youtubers"></span></li>
<li>Part of the government's solution to unemployment are massive public works projects and other forms of government employment, similar to the twentieth century's New Deal programs, but on a larger scale.</li>
<li>The unacknowledged part of the solution is a series of seemingly never-ending proxy wars in various parts of the world. Several power blocs are involved in one way or another, cooperating or opposing each other based on a nearly indiscipherable set of objectives and treaties. There is no uniform draft in the United States, but enrolling in an unemployment program could mean compulsary service.</li>
<li>Because of all this, people are willing to put up with a lot more from their employers, and labor conditions have declined markedly in all levels of employment. New legislation has prevented wages from plummeting, but most people are simply happy to have steady-if stagnant-wages.</li>
<li>Appletree is an unusual place, and part of that is caused by the prosperity and newness of the town that contrasts with most other areas in the country. Residents tend to maintain a deliberate ignorance about anything that might upset their view of the town or the Institute.</li>
<li>The Institute, awash in government money, pays its employees well, and this creates opportunity for other businesses in the area. The homeless and other unwanted people aren't allowed to remain in town, though most assume they are simply deported.</li>
<li>The local government is essentially run by the Institute, making it the perfect picture of a "company town". Laws tend to be a lot more fluid, particularly with the town's extraterritorial status, and civil liberties often have more to do with a citizen's importance than most people would feel comfortable with.</li>
<li>These unique factors combined with a population composed mainly of scientists and engineers makes Appletree a very liberated town sexually, and gives it something of a bohemian atmosphere. Some of the few morality laws that do exist seem to be only selectively enforced, and if anything, the Institute seems to be encouraging a more sexualized population.</li>

@@.head3;Breast Variables@@
<br><br>
The breast size guide contains more information about breast variables. The short version is that characters with breasts have two variables that determine their bra size. 1) volume in cubic centimeters. 2) band size in inches. (//Note that because nobody uses actual centimeter values for band size, this is not converted to metric//)
<br><br>
Band size is determined by a combination of weight and shoulder width, while volume is a base statistic that remains the same unless the character gains/loses weight during the game, or becomes pregnant.
<br><br>
Size is reported in two ways, either the bra size //like 32F// or in a raw cup size that is based entirely on volume and a 34 inch band //like E-cup//. Bra size is more representitive of appearance, while the raw cup size is a way to describe volume alone. //saying 'large D-cup' is a lot easier to understand than saying 680cc!// This value is only rarely used, and primarily because it is more representitive for certain gameplay elements like lactation. To convert between the raw cup and bra cup sizes, simply subtract 1 cup size for every 2 inches larger band size, or add 1 cup size for every 2 inches smaller band size.

''C-Strings'' are very different from typical panties, usually being rigid and springy. They are intended to provide the vulva coverage of a G-string, but give the outward appearance of not wearing panties at all, as there is no waist to create a waistline. The front/crotch of the C-string ranges in size from fully covering the pubic mound (similar to a low-front G-string) to only covering the bottom of the pubic mound to be able to stay in place. Because they are held in place by a springy clamping action, they are less comfortable. This means that they are usually worn for sex appeal rather than fashion necessity.

Crotchless panties are intended to be sexy, and thus are usually found on more revealing panty styles. The crotch of crotchless panties are rarely gusseted, and are therefore thin. They start with having a slit down the middle for 'access purposes' while generally containing the inner labia. These can often be indistinguishable from normal lingerie panties at a glance.

''Adhesive Bra'' is a bandless and strapless bra that sticks to the breasts. In the case of larger breasts, these resemble pasties for modesty. For medium to smaller breasts, they can also pull the breasts together and create cleavage. The most common type of adhesive bra is made of silicone but there are ones that are made of foam.

Balconette has become a loosely used term, and it is often misused or confused with a balcony bra (normally called a shelf bra).

A ''Bandeau Bra'' is shaped like a strip over the breasts, sometimes with ruching in the middle. They are kind of a cross between a strapless bra and a tube top. They are made of stretchy fabric so don’t normally have a fastening in the back, instead they go on over the head. Like many strapless bras, they often come with detachable straps so you can wear them with or without.

As there is little to no shaping, this isn’t a supportive bra, it becomes increasingly provocative with larger breasts. There are variations of bandeau bras that have wires and padding to give more lift but a classic bandeau bra is really just a strip of stretchy fabric, and can be really comfy to wear. The bandeau shape has been used in tops and bikinis for a long time, so unlike most bras they don’t have to strictly be underwear, often they are worn to show under clothes for a layered effect, and could even be worn as a decorative tube top.

Contour bra cups are shaped from fabric and a sturdy layer of foam, they will hold their shape whether they are on or off. the fixed shape of the contour bra give breasts a more shapely and smooth silhouette, and also adds the appearance of greater volume. The layer of foam also prevents even very-large nipples from showing through clothing, so they are popular for that reason too.

''Demi-Cup Bra'' ‘Demi’ describes a style of cup shape for a bra. It has a low cut like a balconette, and only just comes up over the nipple. It usually covers more of the breast than the balconette because of the angled cut. It has straps that are widely set, though not as wide as a balconette on average, and usually plunges quite low in the middle to show cleavage.

A ''Molded Cup Bra'' has fabric that has been shaped over a breast mold to give it a pre-defined breast shape.  Fabric with synthetic fibers is stretched over a hot mold form, a second hot piece comes down on top of it and molds the former flat piece of fabric into the shape of a breast.  this piece is now the bra cup and is sewn into a bra frame.  Usually, the fabric is seamless, but molded cups can also contain seams – this gives added support. A molded bra is usually made with a single piece of fabric or has a second layer for opacity and additional strength. It is the ultimate light-weight bra for a woman who wants to feel and look like she’s wearing nothing, but wants the support of a bra.

The shelf bra has strong rigid cups and a sturdy band, and acts quite literally like a shelf for the breasts. Starting from the inter-mammary fold, the breast rests on the cup that extends outward. The slope of the cup determines the breast shape, and can range from nearly horizontal for a stronger push-out or protruding effect, to being curved almost like a normal bra cup for smaller breasts without a significant inter-mammary fold. For medium to large breasts, many start horizontally and taper into a curve for a more shapely appearance while still pushing the breasts outward. Shelf bras leave the nipples completely exposed, and the outward protrusion of the breasts can make them appear significantly larger, particularly for breasts that are already sizable.

''Sports Bras'' are designed to give support during physical activity. They are just about the only bra that serves more than a fashion function, though they are worse for the wearer's health than normal bras if worn for longer than very short periods. There are different types of sports bras that are designed for different activities. A sports bra for yoga will be comfortable and offer greater movement, whereas one for jogging will be firm enough to remove bounce. The shape of sports bras can vary greatly. A racer back is quite common as it gives the wearer's arms and shoulders a good range of motion, the straps can’t fall down, and they can be quite supportive. Some sports bras have underwires, particularly those intended to be worn without a shirt, or those in larger cup sizes. Sports bras no longer need to be plain or unattractive, there are a large variety of attractive or even sexy variants available.
<br><br>
There are two main ways that a sports bra functions, and many modern bras offer a mix of the two methods. The encapsulation method has full molded cups that separate and hold each breast in place individually. These look more like a standard bra. The difference is a standard bra primarily supports from underneath, while encapsulation means the cup should offer support from every direction to reduce any movement while exercising. These are the healthier option, but also require better fitting and do not function as well as the compression type.
<br><br>
Compression bras are made with stretchy fabric and are tight to compress the breasts. This type doesn’t traditionally have cups and usually lacks a clasp or opening. The compression squeezes the breasts, holding them in place during vigorous motion. These are most commonly recommended for those who have become dependent on breast support due to atrophy, as they strongly restrict any movement of the breasts. @@.note;Shown are three sports bras in increasing levels of attractiveness, followed by an encapsulation-style sports bra, and compression style sports bra intended for vigorous exercise.@@

''Pantyhose'' is a thin and sheer type of legwear that is typically used to give legs a smooth appearance and more even color. They differ from stockings because pantyhose have a waist/underwear portion worn over panties that holds the leg portion up. They are less popular in summer because they have a tendency to trap moisture, which can lead of odors.

''Stockings'' is a thin legwear that is usually sheer but that can be more opaque as well. They typically extend to the top or top-half of the thighs (called thigh-highs) though shorter versions exist. Stockings can be held up in different ways, partially depending on the material used. They can be held up by friction in the case of tighter stockings with elasticity. Finer stockings made of silk or other less stretchy fabrics often have an elastic or stretch lace band at the top to hold them up. Some stockings (garter stockings) have a thicker strip of fabric at the top so that they can be clipped to a garter belt. Because the elastic variety has become cheaper and more effective, and because garters require extra work, they have become less common. They are still used to give a sultry appearance in lingerie, and for formal occasions.

''Socks'' differ from stockings in that they are made of a far thicker knit fabric and are never sheer. They can be much warmer than stockings, but lighter varieties can have an open knit to promote breathability. Socks are somewhat elastic even when made of non-stretch material due to their knit, and usually have an elastic band at the top to help hold them up. They are most commonly found in ankle height varieties, but knee-high socks extend to just below the knee and are often found as part of a uniform. A much rarer variety are over-knee socks, which extend over the knee to the lower part of the thigh. These are less comfortable, but can give them more of a stocking appearance when wearing a longer skirt. Socks that extend past the lower thigh are almost nonexistent, and most items called "thigh-high socks" are actually opaque stockings.

''Corset Tops'' look like decorative corsets. Some feature ribbons or ties at the back, and some include boning in the waist. Corsets are one of the oldest types of shapewear available and were worn by both men and women in the 1800s. The garment tightens around the ribcage and waist to shape and support. Corset tops are available in a range of colors, fabrics, and designs, and can be worn to parties or more formal functions, but are not appropriate for business wear. They are often confused with bustiers, but are easy to tell apart. The "corset" portion of the garment does not extend to the breasts, and they have more conservative coverage of the breasts with soft fabric rather than firm cups. They can also have straps, while a bustier does not.

''Tube Tops'' are essentially strapless "tubes" of a stretchy fabric that is worn tightly over the chest and abdomen. The fabric of nicer varieties is not actually a simple tube, and is shaped to be equally tight over the bust and abdomen for a more fitted appearance. Some tube tops have strong elastic straps and other addons to provide support for larger breasts similar to a strapless bra. <b>They shouldn't be worn with a bra</b>, and because of their elastic nature of hugging the body, they can be very revealing of the shape of the breasts and outline of the nipples. Thinner fabric varieties have a very erotic look because of this, but are still considered acceptable for casual wear. All variants look much more erotic with medium to larger breasts if the fabric follows the inter-mammary fold rather than stretching over it.

A ''Bustier Top'' is a form-fitting garment based on a more traditional bustier, which is usually worn as lingerie. Its primary purpose is to push up the bust by tightening against the upper midriff and forcing the breasts up, while gently shaping the waist. The top variant is intended to be worn as outerwear, and may or may not maintain an elaborate lingerie styling. This top has no straps, and <b>is worn without a bra</b>. It pushes the breasts up, out, and together, creating a large amount of visible cleavage. The cups of a bustier top are cut similar to a balconette bra, and are made of a firm material that extends lower into the garment for support. Because there are no straps and firm cups, the wearer has to be careful of movement that will expose the nipple. They also need to regularly check the garment while wearing, as the squeezing push-up nature of the cups can cause the breasts to ride up and eventually expose the areola or even the nipple. Finally, wearers have to be careful of bending over too far, as doing so will usually cause the breasts to fall out of the garment.

''Ultrasheer'' tops have a deliberately sheer appearance, and are somewhat see-through under most lighting conditions. While "Ultra" implies a high denier, as substyle of top it refers to a low-medium denier. This means that strong differences in color will be easily visible, but detail will be heavily obscured. Looking at a braless woman in an ultrasheer top would make her darker areolas visible, but it would not be possible to distinguish nipple from areola under normal conditions except via a protruding outline. Ultrasheer garments are also considered thin, due to the nature of the fabric.
