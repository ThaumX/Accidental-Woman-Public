<p>@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing in the private practice area of the medical district. It's a cluster of small buildings next to Schrodinger Boulevard and the large Arbor Vitae hospital. The medical district as a whole has a large assortment of different buildings, but the gigantic hospital building in the west dwarfs all of them. It's not particularly tall, just large. It's so big that it has a tunnel for traffic passing through it so that the grid of Appletree's streets isn't interrupted. On the other side sits a large assortment of different buildings of varying purposes, housing the private practices of doctors of various specialties and even outpatient medical centers. <<if â†‚.pc.trait.op && â†‚.pc.trait.perceptive != -1 && ( â†‚.skill.probSolving >= 30 || â†‚.skill.org >= 40)>><i>It seems odd to you that there is so much medical capacity for a town with less than 100,000 people. You decide that it must be a combination of the semi-remote location and medical research funded by the institute...</i><<else>><span class="grey"><i>You don't notice anything unusual about the area.</i></span><</if>>
</p>
<p>
Nearby you notice something of a kiosk with a map of the area and several advertisements for various clinics.

@@.head3;L@@ooking around, there's not a whole lot of activity on the streets, probably due to the time. @@.mono;Well, it's not like people would come here to hang out...@@ You see the occasional patient or doctor heading to one building or another, but that's about it. You see a patient wheeled out of a building up ahead, being pushed by a burly orderly. She has bandages on her head, so you assumes she must've had some cosmetic work done. The odd thing is the fact that she's totally topless, with her breasts on display... But there's probably a reason for that, right?<br><br>
