<<elseif ↂ.pc.kink.sub>> 
    Probably because you like to feel a strong companion dominating you, knowing that you are dominated makes you feel more secure and more excited. It piques the relationship, and makes you love sex with the dominant boyfriend by constantly teasing you, and fucking you.<br><br>

    You feel that a dominant partner offers a special time for the relationship, although you always set the appropriate limits for <<him _NPC.main.id>> in life as a couple, in bed, it becomes very spicy and sensual.<br><br>

At the meeting and today, you can see that <<his _NPC.main.id>> gaze is distant, and <<he _NPC.main.id>> looks thoughtful.

You look bored, did something happen?@@ At some point you decide to press, rolling your eyes, and just wrap your arms around <<= aw.date.name>>'s neck, staring into <<his _NPC.main.id>> eyes. <<he _NPC.main.id>> involves you in a hug, taking a few seconds to gather the appropriate words.<br><br>

@@.npc;Yeah, so so, I feel like it's the right time to, you know... Take things further, between us.@@ <<he _NPC.main.id>> says, smiling at you, before planting a quick kiss on your lips and continue. @@.npc;Do you want to marry me?@@<br><br>

At that point, you understand what has been in the depths of <<his _NPC.main.id>> thinking for all this time. Before you can answer, <<he _NPC.main.id>> kneels in front of you, holding your hand. If you are my wife, you will be the only mine. @@.npc;I will always be by your side, and I will be the best companion I can be... But of course... I want you to be properly submissive, especially in bed.@@<br><br>

<<if ↂ.pc.kink.dom>> 
    You take this as a direct challenge, feeling <<his _NPC.main.id>> gaze fixed on your face, <<he _NPC.main.id>> waits for an answer. You feel your pride hammering hard inside you, without wanting to be submissive to anyone else, and end up squeezing <<his _NPC.main.id>> hand tightly while feeling a wave of thoughts overtake your mind. Although you need to give your boyfriend an appropriate response.<br><br>
<<elseif ↂ.pc.kink.sub>> 
    <<his _NPC.main.id>> proposal makes you feel a strong mix of feelings, especially excitement. Having an assertive partner who wants to dominate you makes you feel a strong urge to accept, especially the trust that already exists between you and <<him _NPC.main.id>>.<br><br>
<<else>> 
    <<= aw.date.name>> seems to want a traditional wife, in that sense. You know that a submissive wife is something very traditional, but it is being forgotten these days. Only a few men are still dominant and want their wives to be that way. @@.mono;That wouldn't be a problem if he's a good man... Shit, this is hot!@@ You bite your bottom lip when your mind is flooded with thoughts of submissive sex, although you are not particularly submissive in bed, a dominant partner is still something hot and exciting.<br><br>

A few seconds pass while a wave of thoughts invades your mind, but you need to respond appropriately to it.<br><br>

        <<he _NPC.main.id>> takes a few seconds, seeming to make a difficult decision, but when <<he _NPC.main.id>> smiles in your direction you begin to understand what <<he _NPC.main.id>> is going to say. @@.npc;I do, how could I deny it? I love you, and I want to make you a very happy, beautiful thing!@@ You kiss <<him _NPC.main.id>> immediately, hardly giving <<him _NPC.main.id>> a chance to finish <<his _NPC.main.id>> words, taking <<him _NPC.main.id>> by surprise. But <<he _NPC.main.id>> quickly returns the kiss and begins to gently feel your butt, squeezing it lightly. You keep the kiss for several seconds, before breaking and smiling intensely at <<him _NPC.main.id>>, feeling your insides start to boil with barely contained lust. @@.npc;Heh, I can't wait for our honeymoon, you know... I'm going to mount you and drain you until there's nothing inside your balls.@@<br><br>

        <<he _NPC.main.id>> gives you a nervous smile, but <<his _NPC.main.id>> look shows that <<he _NPC.main.id>> feels the same lust burning inside <<him _NPC.main.id>>. The next moments of the meeting are divided between caresses and kisses, but you soon remember that there is a lot to plan. @@.pc;But... We have to plan all the stuff, a nice wedding is not done in one day!@@ After a few moments of talking, you start to take all the wedding planning into your hands, and <<= aw.date.name>> again starts to take a back seat. @@.pc;Hey, come on... Don't make that face! I deserve a beautiful dress and a decent wedding! Without saving money. Heh@@ <<= aw.date.name>> gives you a nervous smile, although, like everything else in the relationship, you are the most dominant part.<br><br>

    Those are the most difficult seconds at this point in relationships, but you just look <<him _NPC.main.id>> in the eye with expectation in your heart. But <<his _NPC.main.id>> words come in a harsh, unexpected tone. @@.npc;Listen... I understand, you want to speed things up. But I don't feel that this is the right time.@@ <<he _NPC.main.id>> touches your hips, taking a breath before continuing, seeming to gather the appropriate words. @@.npc;Let's wait, okay? I want to see how things evolve as we... And we know each other better, but no, not yet.@@<br><br>

    You get it in the worst possible way, and it freezes in place for a few seconds, but looking away from <<his _NPC.main.id>> eyes, and just trying to gather your thoughts. @@.pc;Yeah... Got it, you don't feel like you love me enough to marry me.@@ Declaring in a discouraged tone, you soon start to feel frustration and let go of <<his _NPC.main.id>> embrace before declaring. @@.pc;Just pretend that none of this happened.@@ Taking a step forward, and then crossing your arms, the frustration starts to turn to anger, but you ignore it.<br><br>

    @@.npc;C'mon, hot thing, let's not do this personally... I just want to make sure it's the right step for both of us.@@ <<he _NPC.main.id>> tries to cheer you up, but throughout the meeting, you try to maintain the posture of before, forgetting that you have just been rejected, but it certainly affected your relationship with <<= aw.date.name>>.<br><br><br>
<<elseif aw.date.eligible[2] === 'too soon'>>
    You wait for a couple of tortuous seconds, but <<his _NPC.main.id>> response is followed by a nervous expression. @@.npc;Ehh, I think this is kind of early, isn't it? We need to get to know each other better, babe!@@ <<he _NPC.main.id>> squeezes you in an even tighter hug, then adds. @@.npc;I want you to be the right person, and I want me to be the right person for you, too, but we need more time to know... I'm sorry. It is not the time yet.@@ <<he _NPC.main.id>> smiles at you, trying to soften <<his _NPC.main.id>> words so as not to hurt you.<br><br>

    You look at the floor, pondering it, and trying to absorb the shock. After all, this is still a rejection. @@.mono;Well, I think he's right... But I was willing to bet. Shit...@@ You feel frustration taking over your heart, and let go of <<his _NPC.main.id>> embrace. @@.pc;Let's just forget about it then, pretend I never asked you about marriage, okay?@@<br><br>

    You look <<him _NPC.main.id>> in the eye with an expression of disdain, although you are not very hurt, your female pride is hurt. @@.npc;Don't be like this, hot thing... Now I feeling like an asshole! By the way... As we are going, we will certainly get married in the future. Heh@@ You roll your eyes, trying to continue your date, although your wounded pride will not go away for some time.<br><br><br>
<<elseif aw.date.eligible[2] === 'low like' | 'low love'>>
    A few difficult seconds pass, and you freeze while waiting for an answer. But <<= aw.date.name>>'s expression indicates a tough, and rather cold, response. @@.npc;I don't feel like we're... Well, ready for that kind of thing. I don't know if... We have a strong enough bond to get married. I'm sorry, but no.@@ <<he _NPC.main.id>> releases you from the embrace, just touching your right hand on your hips, but then <<he _NPC.main.id>> adds.<br><br>

    @@.npc;If you want to wait, I wouldn't mind, you know, we need to get to know each other better. Maybe one day...@@ <<he _NPC.main.id>> gives you a casual, calm smile, and sees you next. The way <<he _NPC.main.id>> handled your marriage proposal was quite direct and superficial, you can say that <<he _NPC.main.id>> still doesn't feel significant for you, due to the cold way <<he _NPC.main.id>> handled this matter. @@.pc;So... I don't mean much to you, do I?@@ You let go of <<his _NPC.main.id>> embrace, and you begin to feel the anger and frustration building inside of you, but you don't express it directly.<br><br>
