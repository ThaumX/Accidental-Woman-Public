<p>@@.head3;T@@he Thornton Institute of Technology & Science. A vast complex of research and testing facilities for all manner of scientific and technological pursuits, it employs tens of thousands of people<<if setup.job.institute()>> including you. After a quick scan at the gate to confirm your identity, you're admitted to the campus. It seems like the place always has something going on, but you suppose that not all science can be confined to business hours.<<else>>. Unfortunately that doesn't include you, so you have to sign a bunch of forms and wear a bright yellow visitor's pass.<</if>></p>
<<tutorial "mapInstitute">>This area is the primary workplace in the game. You'll be able to manage some job-related affairs here, as well as participate in some other activities such as visiting the Employee Enrichment Center. While you won't need to come here very often, you may want to consider stopping by occasionally to see what's going on.<</tutorial>>
