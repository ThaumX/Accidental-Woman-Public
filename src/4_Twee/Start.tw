<<tab>><span style="font-size:1.25rem;">WARNING!</span> 
      <p>It has been detected that your display resolution is currently below the minimum necessary to display the game properly! The game is playable this way, however many elements of the game may not display in an ideal way, and some elements will be cut off or require scrolling to view. As long as you understand this, you're free to play at whatever resolution you wish. If you encounter a situation where you can't properly continue because of your resolution, I suggest correcting it temporarily to continue.</p>
      <p><b>Accidental Woman is optimized for a vertical resolution of 950 pixels, with a pixel density of at least 96dpi.</b> Nearly all computers and tablets will be able to meet this requirement. If you are seeing this message, there are a couple potential causes related to your device or browser settings. Below is some text to let you know if the issue is related to your vertical resolution, or your display scaling. Red text indicates the requirement wasn't met.</p>
      <p> <span class="screenRezWarn" style="font-weight:bold">Vertical Resolution</span><<tab>>

      <dl>
        <dt><b>Pixel Density</b></dt>
        <dd>Your display scaling is enlarged--Display scaling changes the effective "zoom level" of your display, reducing the effective display resolution, without changing the actual resolution. This issue is common on devices with small screens, such as 13" laptops. SOLUTIONS:
          <ul>
            <li>Change your browser's zoom level (see below), to less than 100%. This doesn't affect the rest of your computer, so may be your prefered option. Your display will probably still be detected as having a too-low DPI by this game, but will play normally. Reduce your zoom until content fits comfortably on your screen. If your display scaling is set to 125%, reducing the zoom level to 80% should be effective.</li>
            <li>Adjust your display scaling to a lower level. To change the display scaling on Windows, right click the desktop and select the "display settings" option. Under Scale and Layout, change the display scale to a lower setting (100% if you have a standard 1920x1080 display). You will likely need to restart your computer. For Linux & Mac, the process is similar but menus/names differ.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Resolution</b></dt>
        <dd>Your browser window simply isn't big enough. This can be caused by a couple different things, which are outlined below.
          <ul>
            <li>Your browser zoom is too high--Most browsers have a "zoom" setting that enlarges the size of items on a webpage. Many browsers, such as Chrome, allow you to adjust the zoom level for certain pages. Reduce the zoom level to 100%, or until the display properly fits within the window.</li>
            <li>Your Desktop Layout--You may not have your browser maximized, or you may have a combination of a large OS task bar and and/or browser UI, leaving too little room for the game. This can be resolved by maximizing your browser, and if necessary, using F11 to view the browser window full-screen. (Or adjusting your PC/browser settings to occupy a more sensible amount of screen real estate.)</li>

Accidental Woman was unable to load necessary resource files. There are a couple possible causes for seeing this message, but all are quite easy to fix. Follow the below instructions to determine the problem. If you still have problems after following the instructions, visit the [[AW Discord Server|https://discord.gg/VYNaMBU]] for assistance. State your problem and you should receive help pretty quickly. (<i>Depending on the time of day it may take a bit, but will still be faster than leaving a comment or forum post.</i>)
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Didn't Download</b></dt>
<dd>You must download the .awr resource files in order to play this game. For Patron releases, these are often seperate downloads than the main .html file. Download the archive with the awr files, and extract it. Follow the instructions inside (readme) to use them.</dd>
<dt><b>Didn't Extract</b></dt>
<dd>While autoloading is now a reality, you must still extract the awr files for them to be useable.</dd>
<dt><b>Missing Files</b></dt>
<dd>There are a total of 9 awr files. If one or more file is missing, it will prompt this message. It is possible that you downloaded an update archive, instead of the full set. In order to limit download size, releases are often made with two versions of the AWR archive. The update version only contains files with changes from the last release, and isn't a complete set. Go back and download a full set.</dd>
<dt><b>Incorrect Location</b></dt>
<dd>The awr files must be in a specific location (with specific filename - do not rename awr files!) to be read by the game. Wherever you have the AW html file located, you should have a folder named "resources". All the awr files should be located in this folder. [ /resources/Ainfo.awr ] <span class="import"><b>Do Not</b> put your game html file <i>inside</i> the resources folder!</span></dd>
<dt><b>Other...</b></dt>
<dd>Certain unsupported (IE, Edge, Safari for Windows) browsers may have problems loading local files, but these browsers won't run the game correctly anyway. Security software or extensions may be preventing your browser from properly running JavaScript. Extensions such as "noscript" must be disabled. While unlikely, it's possible the awr files were corrupted during download or when extracting them. I recommend using 7Zip (it's free!) to extract from archives.</dd>

:: StartTooFewImagesWarning [nobr]

<center><span style="font-size:38px;">! WARNING !</span></center>
<div style="position:absolute;left:20px;right:30px;top:55px;bottom:20px;overflow-y: auto;padding-right:10px;">
<p>
Accidental Woman was expecting <<= setup.expectedImageLength>> images, but only <<= setup.totalloadedimages>> were found.
<br>
This most likely means that one or more of your awr files is out of date. Please make sure that you have the most recent AWR files, I recommend downloading the complete set for the version of the game you are playing and replacing/deleting all of the awr files you currently have. It's also possible that I made a mistake and forgot a modified file in the "update" resource pack, and downloading the full set will solve that problem. (please let me know if this seems to be the case so that I can fix it. :)
</p>
<p>
If the number of missing images is small, you can probably still play the game (potentially in a degraded way) without them. If you see the missing image symbol while playing, you've 'found' one of the missing images. Most links using these images should still work, but probably won't be obvious.<br>

:: StartBrowserFeatureWarning [nobr]

<center><span style="font-size: 34px; color:orange;">CAUTION!</span></center>
<p>
Accidental Woman requires an up-to-date modern browser to play correctly. A feature check determined that your browser doesn't support the expected range of functionality. This is a secondary check, so it's entirely possible that your browser will work fine, however please be aware that you may run into issues during play. If you experience a large number of errors, you may wish to try a different browser.
