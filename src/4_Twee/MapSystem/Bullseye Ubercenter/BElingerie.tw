@@.head3;Y@@ou are standing in the underwear section of Bullseye's women's clothing department. For some reason, they seem to think this is also a good place for jewelry. You notice that Bullseye has posted several warning notes in the bra section.

Only wear brassiers that fit properly. Ill-fitting brassiers intensify the health consequences listed above.<br>b. Do not wear a brassier longer than 4 hours at a time.<br>c. For each hour a brassier is worn, allow your breasts to rest at least 30 minutes before wearing one again.<br>d. Do not wear a brassier more than 8 hours in a 24 hour period.<br>e. Count each hour spent wearing a compression brassier, commonly called a "sports bra", as 3 hours of normal wear.<br><br>''Personal Indemnity Act of 2020 Notice''--According to the Personal Indemnity Act, otherwise known as "Trump Care", your medical insurance claims or federal healthcare coverage (such as Medicare or Medicaid) can be denied if your condition was potentially caused by your own actions or negligence. Visit www.fda.gov/pia/brassiers to learn more about what health coverage you may lose from brassier use.@@ <br><<comment "The medical part is true, but nowhere near bad enough for the gov't/FDA to do anything about it. Fun fact: A large study in france found that wearing bras rapidly accellerates the sagging of breasts, with the effect being worse the larger the breasts were.">><</dialog>><</button>>
