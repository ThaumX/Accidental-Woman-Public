@@.head3;Y@@ou're standing outside of a huge building that proclaims itself to be the Applewood mall. It has the same redbrick exterior as the other buildings downtown, but looks a bit more like a warehouse or mill from the outside. There's a sign displaying the movies currently playing at the Peeper Theaters, like "Come Fill the Cup", "5 Fingers", and "Journey for a Happy Ending".
