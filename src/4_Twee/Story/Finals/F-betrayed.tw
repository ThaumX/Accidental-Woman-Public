    <center><b>ENDING 3 of 5</b></center><br>
    <p>[This is a placeholder text for the game end. It will be expanded and possibly rewritten in next releases!]</p>
    <p>Rejuvenator hums as Lily pressing buttons. You feel weird but this time it is expected. Before you lose your consciousness you see Lily smiling at you from the upside. Her grin is a bit odd but everything is getting blurry...</p>
    <p>Slowly you wake up. Everything changed once again. You breathe differently, your heart beats differently, your skin feels brand new. Carefully you try to stretch yourself to get used to your old body... @@.mono;I feel sick like I felt that time... wait, something is wrong.@@ You lean forward and try to focus on your body but you aren't able to move much. Your body does respond, it just lacks the limbs. Blinking in a panic you try to raise your arms to see them but nothing happens. You don't even have stumps, any flesh further your shoulders is gone. @@.pc;MMMHH!@@ Instead of a call for help you moan incoherently but that is not the biggest issue. Looking down you see a giant pair of boobs blocking your view on your lower torso. With a desperate effort, you manage to raise your head enough to see over them just to see the absence of your lower limbs as well.</p>
    <p>Sweating and almost unconscious from panic you struggle on the rejuvenator bed until you hear the door creaks. @@.mono;Oh, thank god, it's Lily... She will fix everything!@@ Lily's blurred face gets into view above you. @@.pc;MMM! MMMHHMMH!@@ Richards smiles. @@.npc;I know, I know, <<name>>, you probably feel panic now. Don't bother to talk you aren't able to speak coherently.@@ Your face must be expressing such level of shock that Lily bursts into a laugh. @@.npc;Just look at yourself, so surprised with your current condition. Oh, you were probably expecting that I will just swallow everything you did and said to me? Because of you, my machine was ruined putting me under the massive risk of my work being uncovered by the Institute, you were a total jerk to me, you basically failed <<if $AW.startMale>>both as a male and as a female<<else>>both prior the incident and after it<</if>>... something never changes, yeah? So I decided to make you something else.@@</p>
    <p>Your eyes widen while you try to get the emotions on her still heavily blurred face. It seems your vision was affected a lot too because it just doesn't get better since you awoke. Lily sighs and sits on the rejuvenator bed moving you to the side with her hip. @@.npc;You see, back in the times I really was into you. Then things happened. I was hoping that this will be a fresh start, a new sparkle for us... but you managed to ruin everything.@@ She looks up reflecting. @@.npc;At first I was angry, like really angry at you. But, you see, I am not the person you knew in the college anymore. I've changed a lot and so my views did too. And that incident made me rethink a lot about my life. So I decided that I must focus on my own happiness, pleasure, and well-being.@@ She puts her leg over you and sit on your torso just below your new massive tits; you gasp for air while her butt pushes on your chest. @@.npc;And that gave a new perspective. And an idea on how to fix everything. You see, you are the problem. I don't want to kill you since you can be so useful for my researches. And also may want somebody to warm my bed at night. But you need to be dealt with. So, here comes the solution, you will become my pillow! Isn't it a smart solution, mm?@@</p>
    <p>You start struggling but Richards easily outpowers your limbless body. @@.npc;Hush, hush my darling pillow. You won't be able to run away like this anyway. Not with your vision reduced down to be considered legally blind. Ah, yes, your vocal cords were also modified so moaning and pain are the only sounds you are capable to produce now. I made some more alterations to your genome; libido, pain threshold... we will have such a nice time together exploring it!@@ Suddenly, she claps her hands and you flinch. @@.npc;Ah! I almost forgot you have a new set of boobs, I guess you probably already noticed them! So your milk production will make possessing you a profitable business as far as I hope. Can't wait to show you the milking machine I crafted for your new titties!@@</p>
    <p>Pleased with the sheer horror of realization on your face she lifts herself up from you and stands at the side. @@.npc;I will transfer you up tomorrow I believe, need to find a bag or something... Until then, make yourself at home, giggle!@@ She walks to the door accompanied by the desperate moan coming from your genetically simplified vocal cords. @@.pc;MMMHHMMHMMH!!@@ In the doorway she turns, her barely recognizable figure is drowning in the light coming from the street. @@.npc;Good night, pillow!@@ Door closes and you submerge into the silence and darkness.</p>
    <p>Your new life begins.</p>
