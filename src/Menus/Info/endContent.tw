After this point in the story:
<br>➤ <s>Lily will lend you some ill-fitting workout clothes (just how they fit will depend on your character's physical attributes).</s> 
<br>➤ <s>She goes off to work where she plans to work on altering and forging your documentation,</s>
<br>➤ <s>and sends you to the local @@.ident;Bullseye@@ (T@rget) to get some basic shopping done.</s>
<br>➤ <s>You'll get an introduction to the clothing system,</s>
<br>➤ <s>and be able to browse other areas in the store and get a idea of what kinds of things you can buy</s> for your home or otherwise.
<br>➤ <s>You'll do some paperwork with Lily to set some game options.</s>
<br>➤ <s>Lily will give you a little talk about grooming, including makeup and hairstyles introducing those things to the player.</s>
<br>➤ <s>The conclusion to the "Coffee Quest" happens Wednesday morning, when it's time to drink coffee (naturally).</s>
<br><br>
Bullseye carries fairly basic clothing, so you'll have to shop downtown at some other boutiques for more formal/sexy/kinky/etc clothing later on.
<br><br>
<br>➤ a tour of @@.ident;Appletree@@.
<br>➤ <s>There's also an introduction to the wardrobe system.</s>
<br>➤ After that, it's getting you a job, whether you take a position at the @@.ident;Institute@@ or decide to look for something different in town.
<br>➤ <s>Finally, you'll be looking at places to rent. (Or you can accept an offer from Lily to stay with her for the time being - if you don't mind the lack of privacy and following her rules.)</s>
<br>➤ The ''weekend'' is moving in (or unpacking at lily's place) and some shopping for necessities,
<br>➤ and your first chance to explore and do whatever you want.
