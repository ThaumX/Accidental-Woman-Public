@@.head3;Y@@ou look around the community area set into the side of central park. There are a few people playing some kind of collectable card game at one of the tables in the covered area, and there's a small refreshment stand set into the closed side of the building. A bored-looking teenager is standing behind the counter. Behind that is a public restroom, and off to the side is a large playground.
