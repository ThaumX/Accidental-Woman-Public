<p><<f y>>ou're inside the Motorboating boating store. The store seems to stock a little bit of everything, from equipment and supplies to care for your boat, to recreational items for having fun on the lake. There's also a section dedicated to fishing poles, gear, and bait, though judging by its size it doesn't seem like fishing is a very popular activity on the lake.</p>

<p><<f y>>ou're standing in the white sand of the resort's artificial beach. The sand extends out into the lake, and because the lake is spring-fed, the water is a lot clearer than you would have expected of a lake. Unfortunately the lake is far to small to have any sort of real waves. <<if $time[0] > 7 && $time[0] < 20>>It's pretty obvious by looking at some of the sunbathers that this is a clothing-optional beach.<<else>>The parasols have all been closed, and the lounge chairs turned on their sides for the night.<</if>></p>
