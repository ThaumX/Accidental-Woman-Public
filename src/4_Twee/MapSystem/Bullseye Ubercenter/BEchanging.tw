There isn't a separate area for men or women, the changing area appears to be unisex. The rooms seem at least reasonably private though, unless someone was bold enough to walk right up to the door and peer underneath. There are blinking red lights on the cameras to help dissuade customers from shoplifting, though they're carefully positioned so that it's obvious they can't see inside the stalls.

@@.head2;(unfinished) Sex Scene Demo@@<br><br>
@@.walter;This is the demo of the sex scene system. As the title mentions, it isn't finished. Because we're using a sophisticated system to allow an unprecedented level of complexity and expandability in our sex scenes, the framework of code supporting that has to come first. The good news, is that once the framework is finished, it's going to be quite easy to add new actions that integrate with the rest automatically. I'll be sharing the object formats, which will make it easy for people to submit their own actions. (The writing will really need to wait for the parsers though!) This object-based approach is also a potential spot for user mods in the form of json files.@@
