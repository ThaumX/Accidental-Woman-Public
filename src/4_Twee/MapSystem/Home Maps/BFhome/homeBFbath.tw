<<f y>>ou are standing in <<name h>>'s bathroom.
<<switch $BFnum>>
<<case 1>>
It's so tiny that it's actually amazing that everything fit into a space so small. The bathroom is about the size of a shower stall, only about as wide as the bathroom door. Unlike most bathrooms, the door opens outward; that's the only arrangement that's physically possible. The whole room is tiled and serves as a shower stall, while the small toilet is built with a tiny sink on top of the tank. A small shelf above the toilet holds everything from shampoo to toothbrushes.
<<case 2>>
It gives a new meaning to the term "compact", with small fixtures and practically no extra space. When you walk in, you nearly have to straddle to toilet to close the door. The shower stall is also extremely small, and you can easily imagine banging your elbows if you don't pay attention while showering. At least the fixtures themselves look to have a reasonable quality; nothing fancy, but functional.
<<case 3>>
It's a small cozy design that makes good use of the available space. There's a small tub and shower combo, a full-size sink, and even a small towel closet. It isn't a luxurious bathroom by any stretch of the imagination, but it's perfectly serviceable, at least as long as only one person tries to use it at a time.
<<case 4>>
It's an efficient bathroom that makes good use of the available space, which is shaped somewhat like an "L". There's a reasonably-sized shower stall, and the toilet has its own nook. The sink looks nice, though it'd be nice if there was at least a little counter space to set things while you're using them. The cabinets on either side of the mirror do give you enough room to store toiletries though.
<<case 5>>
It has an elegant design with plenty of floor space. There is an open shower stall, and the sink sits on an attractive wooden platform. Opposite the sink there is a full-sized linen closet, which forms a comfortable nook for a full-size toilet. The dark tile would probably make the room too dark by itself, but the liberal use of accent lighting keeps that from happening.
<<case 6>>
It's a master bath with elegant high-quality fixtures. There are two sinks and a full vanity, a dedicated soaking tub, and a rather luxurious rainfall shower with a built-in bench. With two windows, the room is filled with natural light during the day. The window over the tub isn't frosted, but the trees outside seem to do a reasonable job of keeping people from looking inside.
<<case 7>>
Luxurious is the best way to describe the large room, which seems to have every feature and comfort you'd ever want in a bathroom. The large rainfall shower takes center stage, with elegant shelves, constant-temperature valves, and plenty of room for two. The custom-built towel cabinets fit elegantly into the space, while cabinets below the vanity provide plenty of room for toiletries. The toilet seems to be a high-tech Asian model, with controls built into the wall next to it.
