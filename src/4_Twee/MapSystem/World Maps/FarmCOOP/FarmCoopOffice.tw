      <p><<f Y>>ou walk up the receptionist to ask a question. @@.pc;Hi, I was wondering, since I'm a coop member, is it possible to get milked in the dairy?@@</p>
      <p>@@.npc;Looking for a taste of the hucow experience?@@ She gives you a knowing smile. @@.npc;Well you're in luck. Just visit the dairy, show the staff your ID card, and ask to get milked. As long as there's an open spot you should be able to use the milkers along with the hucows. That said, you're not going to get paid for the milk that you supply... it's more of an experience thing.@@</p>
      <p>You nod and smile. @@.pc;Thanks for the info!@@</p>
      <p>The receptionist leans forward and talks in a lower voice. @@.npc;They opened it up as part of a program for prospective hucows to learn more about what it's like... but just between you and me, I know a few girls who go for a chance to watch one of our bulls go to work on the hucows.@@</p>
      <p>@@.mono;Well, <i>that</i> sounds interesting!@@</p>
