Lily is laying on the bed naked, and was obviously in the middle of masturbating. She's not stroking a clit though... She still has two fingers from one hand inside her pussy, while the other is grasping an average-sized cock that emerges from just above the top of her slit...

<<comment "While the pc may be a horny nymphomaniac, they also haven't completely lost their reason (yet). Most characters will realize--thanks to a relationship lasting 15 years--that it's a risky idea to recklessly proposition Lily right now. Some may be horny enough to risk it, others will not. The skill check is difficult if they try.">>
