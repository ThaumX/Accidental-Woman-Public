Your chronological, or true age, remains the same at <<print ↂ.pc.main.ageOriginal>>. Biological age determines appearance, and naturally varies from chronological age based on the individual. Biological age has been deemed definitively irrelevant to matters of consent and law by courts in the U.S. and most other countries (Including those in the E.U.). This is of course subject to the same exceptions for mental deficit and medical disorders whereby the individual is deemed unable to care for themselves, such as a situation of substituted consent for medical procedures in a hospital, or the ward and guardianship process whereby an individual, organization, or the state is appointed guardian of a disabled ward, typically a vulnerable adult. These exceptions do not apply in this case, as the player retains their full mental capacity. Setting a low age (25 or less) will typically result in incidents of being carded for purchasing alcohol and the like. Setting an age below 18 will have other impacts, such as suspecting a fake ID, being refused entry, and potential reduced attractiveness to NPCs. Setting a high age will have a corresponding impact to player fertility and attractiveness, starting with minor effects at 35 years of age.@@<br><</replace>><</link>><span id="agenote">.</span></td></tr>

Exposure to this enzyme rapidly degrades the structural integrity of condoms. The longer a condom is exposed to your lubrication (including pre-intercourse activities), the greater the likelihood that it will shred during intercourse or break upon ejaculation. <i>This mutation significantly affects condom effectiveness, but in a manageable way.

You have an extended ovulatory phase during your menstrual cycle that causes you to ovulate multiple times after your first ovulation. This causes your period to be especially brief, your highly-fertile period is greatly expanded, and you are more fertile than normal during the other portions of your cycle. <i>Combining this with Multiple Ovulation could result in some [[interesting|http://i.imgur.com/wD8sPmx.jpg]] results.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
