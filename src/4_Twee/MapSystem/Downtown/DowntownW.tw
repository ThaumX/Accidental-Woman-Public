<p><<f G>>uy nods and asks you to take a seat on the hair salon-looking chair. While he prepares his tattoo machine, needles and transfers the image to your skin with a pen you worry a little about the pain.</p>
<p>@@.pc;It gonna hurt?@@</p>
<p>@@.npc;Hmm, not much, I gonna add some anesthetic  so it must be bearable.@@</p>
<p>He puts on latex gloves and start countouring the image. The tattoo machine creates a steady mesmerising sound just like an electric shaver and the pain is not a thing so you get into some kind of a trance after pretty soon. When he finishes you feel a bit sleepy and stretch carefully to abstain from damaging the fresh tattoo.</p>
<p>@@.npc;Done, kiddo. Looking good for me. It will take a day or two to heal completely, dont rub it till then.@@</p>
<p>You pay for the services and leave.</p>

You see some client already decided what tattoo she wants. It seems that this piece of art is almost done altough she may want to color it later.
