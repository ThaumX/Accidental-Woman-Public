:: DowntownFoodcourtLOC [nobr]

You take a look around the food court, watching some of the other people going about their business...<br>
<<set _rando = either(true,false)>>
<<if _rando>>
You notice a woman ordering at the McDongald's who is wearing a nice-looking short skirt. It seems her purse got caught on the hem, and as she shifts it around to get her phone out the skirt gets pulled most of the way up her butt. It seems she isn't wearing any underwear either...<br>

<<else>>
You notice a young woman eating what looks to be SBARFO, at one of the children's benches near the food court playground. She's wearing a button-down one-piece dress with a short skirt, and it looks like she's going commando. As you look, she nonchalantly spreads her legs and pulls the hem up farther to give anyone looking that direction a good view. You quickly glance up, worried that you had been caught staring, but she doesn't seem to be flashing you in particular...<br>
