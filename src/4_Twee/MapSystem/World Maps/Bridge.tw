Apparently this bridge has always been known as Sahnetorte, no matter how many times it has been rebuilt. This iteration is a modern structure of steel and concrete to support vehicle traffic.</p>

<<f y>>ou spend some time gazing at the cool water flowing below you. The water seems enticing, and if it wasn't for the rumble of traffic this would be a really relaxing spot.
