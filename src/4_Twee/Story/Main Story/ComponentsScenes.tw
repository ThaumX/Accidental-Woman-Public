<p><span class="handwriting wdGray">IR Field Coherer is a pretty common part, it is used in many biologies and genetic scientific equipment. Well, I mean in high-end equipment. The trick is that I already 'borrowed' four of them while building and testing the machine. Rejuvenator needs only one to be built but... well I'll admit I just burned first three trying to tune the coherency, those field coherers were never intended to be used like that in the first place. Anyway, they noticed that valuable parts began to go missing and started the investigation. Right now I am safe but I just can't risk taking one more coherer from work so we need to find it elsewhere. I'd say the most obvious place to find it is the PSGMRI scanners. I saw at least one of those in the hospital here in the town. Maybe they have some replacement parts in the storage in the building too, this is pretty likely since field coherers are not very sturdy. Or you may just break the expensive machine and salvage the part. You won't miss it, it is a black case, just look at the picture. Anyway, please don't put yourself under any risk, the worst thing we can end up with is you get caught red-handed stealing pricey equipment from the hospital.</span></p>
<p>You think about the task for a minute. @@.mono;I doubt there is way too much security in the hospital... but on the other hand I can guess there are always some people in the building, it is a 24/7 medical facility after all... Not that I have any choice, right?@@</p>

<p><span class="handwriting wdGray">Getting the Resonance Oscillator is a bit of a gamble. Those are mainly used in military equipment, some kind of missiles targeting, or something. It seems they use those for advanced optics but in our case, it serves as a focusing tool for the helium-argon lasers to control the dynamic frequency of the beam and induce gene rearrangements. Those oscillators have never made their way to the public market so I basically repaired one I have found on the black market while building the first rejuvenator. That one was heavily damaged but the optical fiber coils were still intact so it was just a matter of time and dedication to making it work once again. Luckily for us, I have obtained the contacts of this girl, Maria. I have no idea where she got the oscillator but she claims it works fine and although it is an older version I am almost sure we can use it. We arranged the meeting in two days at "Hinden Burger", she will be wearing a black coat. I know that it sounds like a crazy spy TV series but she insisted on meeting there, she even provided me with a code word, "Astoria", Don't forget it please, we can't afford to lose the chance to put our hands on this oscillator, it can take months to find another one.<br><br>P.S. I already paid for the thing so you just need to say the password and take the box.<br><br>P.P.S. Check it before leaving!</span></p>

<p><span class="handwriting wdGray">The Magnetic Flux Capacitor is the important piece we need. To be precise we actually need to salvage it for the impeller but it is nearly impossible to get the thing separately so we are hunting for the Capacitor. Those things are also pretty rare due to the rare materials involved in the manufacturing and the fact that it has not much used out of biology researches at this moment. Due to legal issues and that less-than-sane corporate war with China, high tech things like this are under heave restrictions... Anyway, my good friend told me that this Russian mafia guy, Oleg Bestiarovich may have some. My friend from the town archive told me that there is a pretty big warehouse registered at his wife at the industrial district. Most probably it is the place where he stores all his shady business supplies. Also, he has some legal business in the club district so maybe you can find him there if you want to negotiate the deal. Frankly, I really have no idea how to get it. Flux Capacitors are extremely pricey and buying it on the dark market will crank up the price even higher. I'd say try to test the waters and for the love of God, stay safe! Those guys are shady as heck.</span></p>

<p><span class="handwriting wdGray">Spectral lenses set is a bit of a gamble. It is pretty legal to buy although I know only two places in the valley we can obtain it. Such lenses are used in some high tech equipment, so try to look at the tools and hardware shops in the town, maybe we could find it for a reasonable price. The second option sounds more like insanity for me so it should be a last resort, to be honest. I know they have a stock of them at the facility to the north of the Freeman Rd. This facility is not what it looks like and I don't know much about it. They pretend it is just a farm but it is certainly has nothing to do with agriculture. Still, I overheard one of the guys working with me talking about lens sets they use so they 100% must have some stock there. I really can't ask you to try to get into well-protected institute location so please try your best at obtaining it legally.</span></p>

You chug екнштп to keep his semen out of your lungs and let it to flow right to your stomach gulping it. When his dick stops twitching you carefully remove yourself from his cock.
